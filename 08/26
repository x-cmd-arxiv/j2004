The gas temperature is determined from a\nheating-cooling balance equation in which processes such as photoelectric\nheating, dissociative heating, dust-gas thermal heat exchange and line cooling\nare included. The abundances of the dominant cooling species such as CO, C, C+\nand O are determined from a chemical network based on the atomic species H, He,\nC, O, S, Mg, Si, Fe (Kamp & Bertoldi 2000). The underlying disk models to our\ncalculations are the models of Dullemond, van Zadelhoff & Natta (2002). We find\nthat in general the dust and gas temperature are equal to withing 10% for A_V\n>~ 0.1, which is above the location of the `super-heated surface layer' in\nwhich the dust emission features are produced (e.g. Chiang & Goldreich 1997).\nHigh above the disk surface the gas temperature exceeds the dust temperature\nand can can become -- in the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -- as\nhigh as 600 K at a radius of 100 AU. This is a region where CO has fully\ndissociated, but a significant fraction of hydrogen is still in molecular form.\nThe densities are still high enough for non-negligible H_2 emission to be\nproduced.....(see paper for full abstract)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2004 13:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Although the quarks carry unit intrinsic\nelectric charge in this construction, anomaly cancellation constrains the\nLagrangian in such a way that the quarks' associated currents couple to the\nphoton with the usual 2/3 and 1/3 fractional electric charge associated with\nconventional quarks. The resulting model is identical to the Standard Model in\nthe $SU_C(3)$ sector: However, in the $U_{EW}(2)$ sector it is similar but not\nnecessarily equivalent. Off hand, the model appears to be phenomenologically\nequivalent to the conventional quark model in the electroweak sector for\nexperimental conditions that preclude observation of individual constituent\ncurrents. On the other hand, it is conceivable that detailed analyses for\nelectroweak reactions may reveal discrepancies with the Standard Model in high\nenergy and/or large momentum transfer reactions.\n  The possibility of quarks with integer electric charge strongly suggests the\nnotion that leptons and quarks are merely different manifestations of the same\nunderlying field. A speculative model is proposed in which a phase transition\nis assumed to occur between $SU_C(3)\\otimes U_{EM}(1)$ and $U_{EM}(1)$ regimes.\nThis immediately; explains the equality of lepton/quark generations and\nlepton/hadron electric charge, relates neutrino oscillations to quark flavor\nmixing, reduces the free parameters of the Standard Model, and renders the\nissue of quark confinement moot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2004 15:52:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 19:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

The evolutionary stability of populations has\nbeen analysed in the literature for the case where mutations in the population\nmay be considered as isolated events. For this case, and assuming simple\ntrigger strategies and many iterations per game, we analyse the rate of\nconvergence to the evolutionarily stable populations. We find that for some\nvalues of the payoff parameters of the Prisoner's Dilemma this rate is so low\nthat the assumption, that mutations in the population are infrequent on that\ntimescale, is unreasonable. Furthermore, the problem is compounded as the group\nsize is increased. In order to address this issue, we derive a deterministic\napproximation of the evolutionary dynamics with explicit, stochastic mutation\nprocesses, valid when the population size is large. We then analyse how the\nevolutionary dynamics depends on the following factors: mutation rate, group\nsize, the value of the payoff parameters, and the structure of the initial\npopulation. In order to carry out the simulations for groups of more than just\na few individuals, we derive an efficient way of calculating the fitness\nvalues. We find that when the mutation rate per individual and generation is\nvery low, the dynamics is characterised by populations which are evolutionarily\nstable. As the mutation rate is increased, other fixed points with a higher\ndegree of cooperation become stable. For some values of the payoff parameters,\nthe system is characterised by (apparently) stable limit cycles dominated by\ncooperative behaviour.

There\nwere done experiments on interference of probabilities for ensembles of\nstudents and a nontrivial interference was really found. One could say that the\nquantum statistical behaviour might be expected. But the problem was not so\ntrivial. Yes, we might expect nonclassical statistics, but there was no reason\nto get the quantum one, i.e., cos-interference. But we got it!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2004 08:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 14:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

We show that the lifetime of (distillable)\nentanglement for GHZ-type superposition states decreases with the size of the\nsystem, while for a class of other states -namely all graph states with\nconstant degree- the lifetime is independent of the system size. We show that\nthese results are largely independent of the specific decoherence model and are\nin particular valid for all models which deal with individual couplings of\nparticles to independent environments, described by some quantum optical master\nequation of Lindblad form. For GHZ states, we derive analytic expressions for\nthe lifetime of distillable entanglement and determine when the state becomes\nfully separable. For all graph states, we derive lower and upper bounds on the\nlifetime of entanglement. To this aim, we establish a method to calculate the\nspectrum of the partial transposition for all mixed states which are diagonal\nin a graph state basis. We also consider entanglement between different groups\nof particles and determine the corresponding lifetimes as well as the change of\nthe kind of entanglement with time. This enables us to investigate the behavior\nof entanglement under re-scaling and in the limit of large (infinite) number of\nparticles. Finally we investigate the lifetime of encoded quantum superposition\nstates and show that one can define an effective time in the encoded system\nwhich can be orders of magnitude smaller than the physical time. This provides\nan alternative view on quantum error correction and examples of states whose\nlifetime of entanglement (between groups of particles) in fact increases with\nthe size of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2004 12:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The coherences in the\ntwo bases are related by a similarity transformation. We characterize the\ngrowth of the multiple quantum coherences via measurements in the two bases,\nand show that the rate varies with the coefficient of the driving term in the\nHamiltonian. Such measurements in non-commuting bases provides additional\ninformation over the 1D method about the state of the spin system.
