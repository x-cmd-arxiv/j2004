These distant red galaxies (DRGs)\nare efficiently selected by the criterion J-K>2.3. We use Chandra data to\nexamine the X-ray emission from DRGs in the 5'x5' FIRES MS1054-03 field. Two of\n40 DRGs with K<22 are detected by Chandra, and we infer that ~5 % of DRGs host\nactive nuclei with L>1.2x10^43 ergs/s. This fraction is smaller than that\ninferred from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, probably largely due to strong\nspectroscopic selection biases. By stacking all undetected DRGs we find that\ntheir average X-ray flux in the 0.5-8 keV band is ~4.6x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2. The\ndetection is only significant in the soft and full energy bands. The mean\ndetection may result from star formation, the presence of low luminosity AGN,\nor a combination of both. Assuming the detection is due exclusively to star\nformation, we find an average instantaneous star formation rate of 214 +- 68\n(random) +- 73 (systematic) solar masses per year, in excellent agreement with\nprevious results from spectral energy distribution fitting when constant star\nformation histories are assumed. These results may imply that DRGs contribute\nsignificantly to the cosmic star formation rate at z~2.5. However, the mean\nX-ray flux strictly provides only an upper limit to the star formation rate due\nto the uncertain contribution of low luminosity, possibly obscured AGNs.\nObservations at other wavelengths are needed to provide independent estimates\nof the star formation rate of DRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2004 21:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2004 18:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For us, a hidden-variable theory is\nsimply a way to convert a unitary matrix that maps one quantum state to\nanother, into a stochastic matrix that maps the initial probability\ndistribution to the final one in some fixed basis. We list seven axioms that we\nmight want such a theory to satisfy, and then investigate which of the axioms\ncan be satisfied simultaneously. Toward this end, we construct a new\nhidden-variable theory that is both robust to small perturbations and\nindifferent to the identity operation, by exploiting an unexpected connection\nbetween unitary matrices and network flows. We also analyze previous\nhidden-variable theories of Dieks and Schrodinger in terms of our axioms. In a\ncompanion paper, we will show that actually sampling the history of a hidden\nvariable under reasonable axioms is at least as hard as solving the Graph\nIsomorphism problem; and indeed is probably intractable even for quantum\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2004 08:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
