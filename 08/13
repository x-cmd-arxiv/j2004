The stellar mass\ndistribution of Class I stars is similar to that of Class II stars and includes\n3 Class I brown dwarfs. Class I stars in Taurus are slowly rotating; the\nangular momentum of a young star appears to dissipate prior to the optically\nrevealed T Tauri phase.

Moreover, because by definition the Universe\ncontains everything, it is argued that these operators must be chosen\nself-referentially; the overall dynamics of the system is envisaged to be\nanalogous to a gigantic, self-governing, quantum computation. The issue of how\nthe Universe could choose these operators without requiring or referring to a\nfictitious external observer is addressed.\n  The processes by which conventional physics might be recovered from this\nfundamental, mathematical and global description of reality are particularly\ninvestigated.
