This is the first cluster catalog\nexploiting the high angular resolution of this instrument. Cluster candidates\nare selected on the basis of their X-ray extension only, a parameter which is\nwell measured by the BMW wavelet detection algorithm. The survey includes 154\ncandidates over a total solid angle of ~160 deg2 at 10^{-12}erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}\nand ~80 deg^2 at 1.8*10^{-13} erg s^{-1}$ cm^{-2}.

We also present a new estimate of\nthe surface density of clusters of galaxies down to a flux of 3*10^{-14}erg\ns^{-1} cm^{-2}, which is consistent with previous measurements from PSPC-based\nsamples. Several clusters with redshifts up to z=0.92 have already been\nconfirmed, either by cross-correlation with existing PSPC surveys or from early\nresults of an ongoing follow-up campaign. Overall, these results indicate that\nthe excellent HRI PSF (5 arcsec ~FWHM on axis) more than compensates for the\nnegative effect of the higher instrumental background on the detection of\nhigh-redshift clusters. In addition, it allows us to detect compact clusters\nthat could be lost at lower resolution, thus potentially providing an important\nnew insight into cluster evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 16:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 13:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The HI structure of UGCA 86 is complex, with two separate\ncomponents: a rotating disk and a highly elongated spur that is kinematically\ndisjunct from the disk. The HI disk is centered on the optical galaxy with\nsimilar axial ratio and orientation of the major axis. An area of the disk with\na peculiar velocity of 25 km/s relative to the regular rotation of the disk is\nfound on the southern side, where most of the star formation is concentrated.\nThe spur is seen along the minor axis of UGCA 86 and overlaps in part with the\ndisk. Towards the optical center of UGCA 86, the velocity difference between\nthe spur and the disk is 40 km/s, about one third of the rotation velocity of\nthe HI disk at 6 kpc from the center. This implies a large radial component of\nthe orbital velocity of the spur, and therefore a significantly non-circular\norbit. The velocity dispersion of the disk is 8.8 km/s, whereas the velocity\ndispersion of the spur varies from 10 km/s to 30 km/s. A possible tidal origin\nof the spur is considered in view of the proximity of the large Scd galaxy IC\n342.

The possibility that the spur\nis part of the nascent cloud of UGCA 86 or the remains of a small dwarf galaxy\nis presented as an alternative interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 23:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

When the ratio of total charges of PA and\nPC in the solution, $x$, equals to 1, complexes are neutral and they condense\nin a macroscopic drop. When $x$ is far away from 1, complexes are strongly\ncharged. The Coulomb repulsion is large and free complexes are stable. As $x$\napproaches to 1, PCs attached to PA disproportionate themselves in two\ncompeting ways. One way is inter-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make\nsome complexes neutral and therefore condensed in a macroscopic drop while\nother complexes become even stronger charged and stay free. The other way is\nintra-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make one end of a complex\nneutral and condensed in a small droplet while the rest of the complex forms a\nstrongly charged tail.

It is refreshing\nto see the public focused, if just for a moment, on an important conundrum that\nhas fascinated theoretical physicists for three decades, and prompted much\nconceptual progress. The scientific issues, however, remain much less settled\nthan Dr. Hawking's celebrated wager on the question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 19:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Can it be used to eliminate\ncommunication altogether? Even though it cannot serve to signal information\nbetween remote parties, there are distributed tasks that can be performed\nwithout any need for communication, provided the parties share prior\nentanglement: this is the realm of pseudo-telepathy.\n  One of the earliest uses of multi-party entanglement was presented by Mermin\nin 1990.

We prove an upper bound on\nthe best possible classical strategy for attempting to play this game, as well\nas a novel, matching lower bound.
