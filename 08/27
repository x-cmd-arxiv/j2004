The masses of\nobjects formed in this way are given approximately by $\\sim 0.010 M_\\odot\n(a_{\\rm I} / 0.3 {\\rm km} {\\rm s}^{-1})^6 (\\dot{\\cal N}_{\\rm Lyc} / 10^{50}\n{\\rm s}^{-1})^{-1/3} (n_{\\rm 0} / 10^3 {\\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1/3} $, where $a_{\\rm\nI}$ is the isothermal sound speed in the neutral gas of the core, $\\dot{\\cal\nN}_{\\rm Lyc}$ is the rate of emission of Lyman continuum photons from the OB\nstar (or stars), and $n_{\\rm 0}$ is the number-density of protons in the HII\nregion surrounding the core. We conclude that the formation of low-mass objects\nby this mechanism should be quite routine, because the mechanism operates over\na wide range of conditions ($10^{50} {\\rm s}^{-1} \\la \\dot{\\cal N}_{\\rm Lyc}\n\\la 10^{52} {\\rm s}^{-1}$, $10 {\\rm cm}^{-3} \\la n_0 \\la 10^5 {\\rm cm}^{-3}$,\n$0.2 {\\rm km} {\\rm s}^{-1} \\la a_{\\rm I} \\la 0.6 {\\rm km} {\\rm s}^{-1}$) and is\nvery effective. However, it is also a rather wasteful way of forming low-mass\nobjects, in the sense that it requires a relatively massive initial core to\nform a single low-mass object. The effectiveness of photo-erosion also implies\nthat that any intermediate-mass protostars which have formed in the vicinity of\na group of OB stars must already have been well on the way to formation before\nthe OB stars switched on their ionizing radiation; otherwise these protostars\nwould have been stripped down to extremely low mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 14:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We perform detailed\nnumerical analyses of lattice multifractals and explain the origin of three\ndifferent scaling regions found in the moments. A novel numerical approach is\nproposed to extract the log-frequencies. In the non-lattice case, there is no\nvisible log-periodicity, {\\em{i.e.}}, no preferred scaling ratio since the set\nof complex exponents spread irregularly within the complex plane. A non-lattice\nmultifractal can be approximated by a sequence of lattice multifractals so that\nthe sets of complex exponents of the lattice sequence converge to the set of\ncomplex exponents of the non-lattice one. An algorithm for the construction of\nthe lattice sequence is proposed explicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 11:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2007 04:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-14"}

The boundary condition at the interface couples transfer from the\nliquid to its vapour and diffusion flux.

We reformulate this model as a random dynamical system.\nFirst, we have shown that the asymptotic dynamics of the coupled\natmosphere-ocean model is described by a random climatic attractor. Second, we\nhave estimated the atmospheric temperature evolution under oceanic feedback, in\nterms of the freshwater flux, heat flux and the external fluctuation at the\nair-sea interface, as well as the earth's longwave radiation coefficient and\nthe shortwave solar radiation profile. Third, we have demonstrated that this\nsystem has finite degree of freedom by presenting a finite set of determining\nfunctionals in probability. Finally, we have proved that the coupled\natmosphere-ocean model is ergodic under suitable conditions for physical\nparameters and randomness, and thus for any observable of the coupled\natmosphere-ocean flows, its time average approximates the statistical ensemble\naverage, as long as the time interval is sufficiently long.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 15:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
