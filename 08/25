For Class II masers, the polarization properties of the various\nvelocity components towards a given source with detectable polarization are\nquite homogeneous. A possible explanation is discussed.

Since linear evolution preserves the\nstatistical properties of the initial conditions, observed non-Gaussianity of\nthe CMB will mirror primordial non-Gaussianity. Single field slow-roll\ninflation robustly predicts negligible non-Gaussianity so an indication of\nnon-Gaussianity will suggest alternative scenarios need to be considered. In\nthis paper we calculate the information on primordial non-Gaussianity encoded\nin the polarization of the CMB. After deriving the optimal weights for a cubic\nestimator we evaluate the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the estimator for WMAP,\nPlanck and an ideal cosmic variance limited experiment. We find that when the\nexperiment can observe CMB polarization with good sensitivity, the sensitivity\nto primordial non-Gaussianity increases by roughly a factor of two.

Here we combine the\nmisalignment measurement with measurements of the pulsar and companion masses,\nthe orbital elements, proper motion, and interstellar scintillation. We show\nthat the orbit of the binary in the Galaxy is inconsistent with a velocity kick\nlarge enough to produce a nearly antialigned spin axis, so the true\nmisalignment must be ~25 deg. Similar arguments lead to bounds on the mass of\nthe companion star immediately before its supernova: 3+/-1 Msun. The result is\na coherent scenario for the formation of the observed binary. After the first\nsupernova explosion, the neutron star that would eventually become the observed\npulsar was in a Be/X-ray type binary system with a companion of at least 10--12\nMsun. During hydrogen (or possibly helium) shell burning, mass transfer\noccurred in a common envelope phase, leaving the neutron star in a roughly\nhalf-day orbit with a helium star with mass above ~3.3 Msun. A second phase of\nmass transfer was then initiated by Roche lobe overflow during shell helium\nburning, further reducing both the helium star mass and orbital period before\nthe second supernova. Scenarios that avoid Roche lobe overflow by the helium\nstar require larger helium star masses and predict space velocities\ninconsistent with our measurements.

We perform computations for various values of the accretion\nrate dm/dt, the fraction f_cor of radiation dissipated within the disk corona,\nand the covering factor f_cover of the disk surface with flare-illuminated\npatches. It turns out that generally we can distinguish three characteristic\nradial zones within the disk showing a qualitatively different behavior of the\nheated material. In the innermost regions of the disk (inner zone) the\nexpansion of the disk material is restricted by strong gravitational forces.\nFurther out, the flare source, initially above the disk, soon becomes embedded\nby the expanding disk atmosphere. At these intermediate disk radii (middle\nzone) the material is optically thick thus greatly modifying the observed\nradiation by multiple Compton scattering. We show exemplary spectra models\nobtained from Monte Carlo simulations illustrating the trends. In the outermost\nregions of the disk (outer zone) the expanding material is optically thin and\nits influence on the observed spectra is smaller but pressure gradients in\nradial directions should cause the development of a fountain-like dynamical\nstructure around the flare source. We discuss the observational consequences of\nour results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2004 13:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It proceeds in a way similar to\nthe treatment of light diffraction by a thin phase grating, and consists in\ncalculating the atomic wavefunction by means of action integrals along the\nclassical trajectories of the atoms in the absence of the modulated part of the\npotential. The capabilities and the validity condition of the method are\nillustrated on the well-known case of atomic diffraction by a Gaussian standing\nwave. We prove that in this situation the perturbation method is equivalent to\nthe Raman-Nath approximation, and we point out that the usually-considered\nRaman-Nath validity condition can lead to inaccuracies in the evaluation of the\nphases of the diffraction amplitudes. The method is also applied to the case of\nan evanescent wave reflection grating, and an analytical expression for the\ndiffraction pattern at any incidence angle is obtained for the first time.\nFinally, the application of the method to other situations is briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2004 09:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
