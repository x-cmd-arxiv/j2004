We examine two\nmechanisms of gamma-ray emission associated with the gradual dissipation of\nthis current. (1) A thin surface layer of the star is heated by the downward\nbeam of current-carrying charges, which excite Langmuir turbulence in the\nlayer. As a result, it can reach a temperature kT ~ 100 keV and emit\nbremsstrahlung photons up to this characteristic energy. (2) The magnetosphere\nis also a source of soft gamma rays at a distance of ~100 km from the star,\nwhere the electron cyclotron energy is in the keV range. A large electric field\ndevelops in this region in response to the outward drag force felt by the\ncurrent-carrying electrons from the flux of keV photons leaving the star. A\nseed positron injected in this region undergoes a runaway acceleration and\nupscatters keV photons above the threshold for pair creation.

We consider\nthat this quiescent phase is kept by lack of H2, which can be important coolant\nto generate the next generation of stars in the low-metal environment like\ndIrrs. Furthermore, in dIrrs, H2 formation through gas-phase reactions may\ndominate the one on dust-grain surfaces because their interstellar medium (ISM)\nare very plentiful and the typical dust-to-gas ratio of dIrrs (D_dIrrs = 1.31 x\n10^-2 D_MW, where D_MW is its value for the local ISM) is on the same order\nwith a critical value D_cr ~ 10^-2 D_MW.

H- is destroyed by the\nradiation from all stars born in the previous starburst phase because H-\ndestroying infrared photon can penetrate the whole ISM of dIrrs.

Our purpose is to test the Cold Dark\nMatter (CDM) model at small and highly non-linear scales where it has been\nclaimed that the CDM model may confront several difficulties. We concentrate\nour attention on the statistics of strong gravitational lenses. We use two\ncomplementary statistics, lensed arcs and quasars, to probe the mass\ndistributions. First, we construct a triaxial lens model, and develop a new\nmethod to include triaxiality of dark halos in the lens statistics. We find\nthat the effect of triaxiality is significant; it enhances lensing\nprobabilities by a factors of a few to ten, assuming the degree of triaxiality\npredicted in the CDM model. In particular, we argue that both central\nconcentration and large triaxiality of dark halos are required to reproduce the\nobserved number of arcs in clusters; thus the result can be interpreted as a\nstrong evidence for the cold and collisionless dark matter. One of the most\nnotable advantages of the triaxial modeling is that the triaxial modeling\nallows us to predict image multiplicities. We find that the CDM halos predict\nsignificant fraction (more than 20%) of naked cusp lenses. In addition, we\npoint out the image multiplicities depend strongly on the central concentration\nof dark halos. Therefore we propose image multiplicities as a new powerful test\nof the CDM model. Finally we searched for large-separation lensed quasars from\nthe data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and succeeded in discovering the\nfirst large-separation lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112.

In the first months of 2004, the source had increased steadily in\noptical brightness and had undergone two outbursts. During the latter, occurred\nin March, it reached the extreme level of R = 12.1 mag, which triggered our\nINTEGRAL program. The target has been detected with IBIS/ISGRI up to 60 keV,\nwith a flux of ~3 x 10e-11 erg/s/cm2 in the 30-60 keV interval, a factor of ~2\nhigher than observed by the BeppoSAX PDS in October 2000. In the field of S5\n0716+714 we have also detected the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar S5 0836+710 and\nthe two Seyfert galaxies Mkn 3 and Mkn 6. Their IBIS/ISGRI spectra are rather\nflat, albeit consistent with those measured by BeppoSAX. In the spectrum of Mkn\n3 we find some evidence of a break between ~60 and ~100 keV, reminiscent of the\nhigh energy cut-offs observed in other Seyfert galaxies. This is the first\nreport of INTEGRAL spectra of weak Active Galactic Nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2004 14:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Following the appearance of Shadrin's proof, it was only very\nnatural to carry the study of $L_\\infty$-boundedness of the orthoprojector over\nto L-splines. This is a modest attempt in the direction.\n  We consider orthoprojectors on spaces of L-splines generated by certain\nsecond-order linear differential operators with constant coefficients. We\nconcern ourselves with whether the $L_2$-norms of the resulting orthoprojectors\nare bounded independenly of the knot sequence.\n  For exponential splines generated by the operator $L=D^2-\\alpha^2$ we find\nthe exact mesh-independent bound, which proves to be the same as in the\ncorresponding polynomial case of linear splines, that is 3. For exponential\nsplines generated by the operator $L=(D-\\alpha^2)(D+\\beta^2)$ we prove\nmesh-independent boundedness without finding an explicit bound.\n  For trigonometric splines generated by the operator $L=D^2+\\alpha^2$ with\nstandard constraints on the partition diameter we find a mesh-independent\nbound. We also consider a model example which shows that the above constraints\nare not necessary for mesh-independent boundedness to hold - due to an\ninteresting \"interference\" phenomenon, the $L_2$-approximant remains bounded\nwhile both its coefficients and the norms of LB-splines tend to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2004 20:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
