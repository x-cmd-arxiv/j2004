In the period range of 7-21\ndays, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits.\nThese will be referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this\ndiscrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young\nstars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal\ndisturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can\nexcite eccentricity growth, and for a more slowly spinning star, at least\nreduce the eccentricity damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the\nenvelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity\ndamping process. Based on these results, we suggest that short-period planets\naround relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity\nthan those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of\nangular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than\nthe tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very-short\n(3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in\nwhich the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and\nsynchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such\nconfigurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with\norbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the\nangular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is\ntherefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such\nstars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2004 18:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We perform a complete\nnumerical solution of these two-dimensional problems for any univalued rough\nsurfaces. We present results for sinusoidal and self-affine surface whose slope\ncan locally reach 2.5. Beyond the numerical solution we present perturbative\nsolutions of these problems. We show in particular that at first order in\nroughness amplitude, the surface stress of a material in uni-axial tension can\nbe directly obtained from the Hilbert transform of the local slope. In case of\nself-affine surfaces, we show that the stress distribution presents, for large\nstresses, a power law tail whose exponent continuously depends on the roughness\namplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2004 05:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Among other things, it is not clear what sets\ntheir tension, what is their relation to the better understood BPS D-branes,\nand why the open string tachyon on them is described by an effective Lagrangian\nwhich suggests that the tachyon corresponds to an extra spatial dimension\ntransverse to the branes. We point out that the dynamics of D-branes in the\npresence of Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes on a transverse R^3 times S^1 provides a\nuseful toy model for studying these issues. From the point of view of a 5+1\ndimensional observer living on the fivebranes, BPS D-branes in ten dimensions\ngive rise to two kinds of D-branes, which are BPS or non-BPS depending on\nwhether they do or do not wrap the S^1. Their tensions are related, since from\na higher dimensional perspective, they are the same objects. D-branes localized\non the S^1 have a tachyon corresponding to their position on the circle. This\nfield is described by the same Lagrangian as that of a tachyon on a non-BPS\nD-brane in ten dimensions. Its geometrical interpretation is useful for\nclarifying the properties of non-BPS branes in six dimensions. If the lessons\nfrom the six dimensional system can be applied in ten dimensions, the existence\nof non-BPS D-branes seems to suggest the presence of at least one extra\ndimension in critical type II string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2004 17:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
