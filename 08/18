Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the\nelemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In\nparticular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR\nankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of\nultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the\ngalaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the\nGalactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the\ninteraction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The\nCR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM\nby the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.\nInverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)\nby the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground radiation (GBR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 16:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

A mobile hole coupled to the spin excitation (magnon) in the\nspin G-type and orbital C-type (SG/OC) ordered phase, and that to the orbital\nexcitation (orbiton) in the spin C-type and orbital G-type (SC/OG) one are\nformulated on an equal footing. The observed fragile character of the (SG/OC)\norder is attributed to the orbiton softening caused by a reduction of the\ntaggered magnetic order parameter. It is proposed that the qualitatively\ndifferent hole dynamics in the two spin-orbital ordered phases in vanadates can\nbe probed by the optical spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2004 09:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Existing research has focused on localization in static sensor\nnetworks where localization is a one-time (or low frequency) activity.

The higher the frequency of localization, the lower the\nerror introduced because of mobility. However, localization is a costly\noperation since it involves both communication and computation.

And we proved the FIC for the\nfundamental groups of members of a subclass of \\cal C. This result was obtained\nby showing that the double of any member of this subclass is either Seifert\nfibered or supports a nonpositively curved metric. In this article we prove\nthat for any M in {\\cal C} there is a closed 3-manifold P such that either P is\nSeifert fibered or is a nonpositively curved 3-manifold and \\pi_1(M) is a\nsubgroup of \\pi_1(P). As a consequence this proves that the FIC is true for any\nB-group (see definition 3.2 in \\cite{R3}). Therefore, the FIC is true for any\nHaken 3-manifold group and hence for any 3-manifold group (using the reduction\ntheorem of \\cite{R3}) provided we assume the Geometrization conjecture. The\nabove result also proves the FIC for a class of 4-manifold groups (see\n\\cite{R2}(math.GT/0209119)).\n  The second aspect of this article is to relax a condition in the definition\nof strongly poly-surface group (\\cite{R1} (math.GT/0209118)) and define a new\nclass of groups (we call them {\\it weak strongly poly-surface} groups). Then\nusing the above result we prove the FIC for any virtually weak strongly\npoly-surface group.

In this theory Maxwell's homogeneous equations\ncorrespond to a generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann regularity conditions to\nfour complex variables, and electrons to singularities in the Maxwell field.\nSince there are no material particles in Lanczos electrodynamics, the same\naction principle applies to both regular and singular Maxwell fields.\nTherefore, the usual action integral of classical electrodynamics is {not} an\ninput in that theory, but rather a consequence which {derives} from the\napplication of Hamilton's principle to a superposition of two or more\nhomogeneous Maxwell fields. This leads to a fully consistent electrodynamics\nwhich, moreover, can be shown to be finite. As byproducts to this remarkable\nthesis Lanczos anticipated the Moisil-Fueter theory of quaternion-analytic\nfunctions by more than ten years; showed that Maxwell's equations are invariant\nin both spin-1 and spin-1/2 Lorentz transformations; that displacing a\nsingularity into imaginary space adds an intrinsic magnetic-like field to its\nelectric field; and that his theory does even include gravitation -- although\nnot in the general relativistic form of Einstein to whom Lanczos dedicated his\ndissertation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 21:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
