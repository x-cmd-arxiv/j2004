Here, the notion and study of\nendomorphic elements of (Banach) algebras are introduced. This study is\ninitiated, in the hope that it will open up, further, the structure of (Banach)\nalgebras in general, enrich the study of endomorphisms and provide examples.\n  In particular, here, we use it to classify algebras for the convenience of\nour study. We also present results on the structure of some classes of\nendomorphic elements and bring out the contrast with idempotents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 04:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2004 06:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
