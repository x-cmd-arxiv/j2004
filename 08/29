The spectra of these objects are defined by strong\nhydrogen Balmer absorption lines (H-delta, H-gamma, H-beta) combined with a\nlack of [OII] 3727A emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst of\nstar formation. The E+A spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the process\nof evolution. We quantify the local environments, clustering properties and\nluminosity function of the E+A galaxies. We find that the environments are\nconsistent with the ensemble of 2dFGRS galaxies: low-redshift E+A systems are\nlocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poor\ngroups. However, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using three\nBalmer absorption lines H-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.\nIndeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (E/S0)\nsystems. In a small but significant number we find evidence for recent major\nmergers, such as tidal tails. We infer that major mergers are one important\nformation mechanism for E+A galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. At low\nredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thus\nthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usual\nmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. Regarding the selection of E+A\ngalaxies: we find that basing the Balmer-line criterion solely on H-delta\nabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems with\ndetectable H-alpha emission. In these objects the [OII] emission is presumably\neither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the\n(H-gamma, H-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2004 05:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-16"}

A large number of\nsmall particles are randomly scattered at an initial time. Each particle has\nsome integer mass and moves in a Brownian motion whose diffusion rate is\ndetermined by that mass. When any two particles are close, they are liable to\ncombine into a single particle that bears the mass of each of them. Choosing\nthe initial density of particles so that, if their size is very small, a\ntypical one is liable to interact with a unit order of other particles in a\nunit of time, we determine the macroscopic evolution of the system, in any\ndimension d \\geq 3. The density of particles evolves according to the\nSmoluchowski system of PDEs, indexed by the mass parameter, in which the\ninteraction term is a sum of products of densities. Central to the proof is\nestablishing the so-called Stosszahlensatz, which asserts that, at any given\ntime, the presence of particles of two distinct masses at any given point in\nmacroscopic space is asymptotically independent, as the size of the particles\nis taken towards zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2004 00:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2005 03:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

This question, which appears in a 2000 paper of Erdos,\nHajnal and Pach, is intimately related to the well-known Erdos-Hajnal\nconjecture via the Milnor-Thom theorem. It was recently resolved by a powerful\nand very general theorem of Alon, Pach, Pinchasi, Radoicic, and Sharir. We\ndescribe these results and discuss several related issues, including a\ngeneralization to ``Erdos-Hajnal sets'' and an intriguing problem concerning\nthe decomposability of semi-algebraic sets: Do all semi-algebraic sets belong\nto the set algebra generated by semigroups in $R^d$?

In free molecular dynamics\nsimulations reversible transitions are induced by changing the size of a water\ndrop around DNA neutralized by Na ions. In poly(dG).poly(dC) the B<->A\ntransitions are easy, smooth and perfectly reversible. In contrast, a B->A\ntransition in poly(dA).poly(dT) dodecamer fragment could not be obtained even\nthough its A-form is stable under low hydration. Normal B->A transitions are\nobserved, however, in long poly(dA).poly(dT) stretches flanked by GC pairs. An\nintermediate range of hydration numbers is identified where opposite\ntransitions are observed in the two dodecamer fragments, namely, A->B in\npoly(dA).poly(dT) and B->A in poly(dG).poly(dC). With hydration numbers close\nto the stability limit of the B-form, the two sequences exhibit qualitatively\ndifferent counterion distributions, with a characteristic accumulation of Na\nions next to the opening of the minor groove in poly(dA).poly(dT).
