This\nsample of galaxies exhibits a correlation between rest-frame blue luminosity\nand gas-phase metallicity (i.e., an L-Z relation), consistent with L-Z\ncorrelations of previously-studied intermediate-redshift samples. The zero\npoint of the L-Z relation evolves with redshift in the sense that galaxies of a\ngiven luminosity become more metal poor at higher redshift. Galaxies in\nluminosity bins -18.5<M_B<-21.5 exhibit a decrease in average oxygen abundance\nby 0.14\\pm0.05 dex from z=0 to z=1. This rate of metal enrichment means that\n28\\pm0.07% of metals in local galaxies have been synthesized since z=1, in\nreasonable agreement with the predictions based on published star formation\nrate densities which show that ~38% of stars in the universe have formed during\nthe same interval.

In this context, the question whether thermodynamics and, in\nparticular, the concept of temperature can apply on the nanoscale is of central\ninterest. Here we consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of\nelementary subsystems with nearest neighbour interactions and assume that the\ntotal system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyse, under\nwhat condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices\nwith respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the\nsame temperature $T$. In quantum systems the minimal group size\n$n_{\\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical\ncase. As examples, we apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and different\ntypes of Ising spin chains. For the harmonic chain, which successfully\ndescribes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first\nquantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can\nexist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the\nDebye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below. We finally apply the\nharmonic chain model to various materials of relevance for technical\napplications and discuss the results. These show that, indeed, high\ntemperatures can exist quite locally, while low temperatures exist on larger\nscales only. This has striking consequences: In quasi 1-dimensional systems,\nlike Carbon-Nanotubes, room temperatures (300 Kelvin) exist on length scales of\n1 $\\mu$m, while very low temperatures (10 Kelvin) can only exist on scales\nlarger than 1 mm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 11:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When\nconventional Kohn-Sham DFT for Coulomb systems is extended beyond the local\ndensity approximation, the kinetic energy density tau is sometimes included in\nenergy functionals in addition to the fermion density. However, a local\n(semi-classical) expansion of tau is used to write the energy as a functional\nof the density alone, in contrast to the Skyrme approach. The difference is\nmanifested in different single-particle equations, which in the Skyrme case\ninclude a spatially varying effective mass. Here we show how to generalize the\nEFT framework for DFT derived previously to reconcile these approaches.

It finds extensive use in the theoretical analysis and\nexperimental measurement of such phenomena as quantum wave packet revivals. We\nevaluate explicit expressions for the autocorrelation function for\ntime-dependent Gaussian solutions of the Schrodinger equation corresponding to\nthe cases of a free particle, a particle undergoing uniform acceleration, a\nparticle in a harmonic oscillator potential, and a system corresponding to an\nunstable equilibrium (the so-called `inverted' oscillator.) We emphasize the\nimportance of momentum-space methods where such calculations are often more\nstraightforwardly realized, as well as stressing their role in providing\ncomplementary information to results obtained using position-space\nwavefunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 13:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For large transition time we show that the quantum\naction functional gives an analytical expression for tunneling amplitudes. This\nhas been confirmed by numerical simulations giving relative errors in the order\nof 1e-5. In contrast to the classical potential, the quantum potential has a\ntriple-well if the classical wells are deep enough. Its minima are located at\nthe position of extrema of the ground state wave function. The striking feature\nis that a single trajectory with a double instanton reproduces the tunneling\namplitude. This is in contrast to the standard instanton approach, where\ninfinitely many instantons and anti-instatons have to be taken into account.\nThe quantum action functional is valid in the deep quantum regime in contrast\nto the semi-classical regime where the standard instanton approach holds. We\ncompare both approaches via numerical simulations. While the standard instanton\npicture describes only the transition between potential minima of equal depth,\nthe quantum action may give rise to instantons also for asymmetric potential\nminima. Such case is illustrated by an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 14:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 21:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
