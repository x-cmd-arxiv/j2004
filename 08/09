However, serious\nproblems are encountered when studying both types of sources, finite and\nextended. In studying a finite source, such as a star, galaxy, or quasar, the\nproblem of its evolution must be dealt with. The same source seen in different\ndirections is observed at different distances (i.e., ages), making its\nidentification extremely difficult. Studying extended sources, such as\ncircles-in-the-sky (CIS) within the cosmic microwave background (CMB), is also\nproblematic since it requires an unrealistic zero width last scattering surface\n(LSS) to produce the predicted identical temperatures on the circles. It is\nshown here that these temperatures are no longer identical when a realistic\nfinite width LSS is taken into account. A new method for studying the topology\nof the universe which avoids the above mentioned problems in studying both\nfinite and extended sources is suggested here. It consists of searching for\nincreased temperature fluctuations in the regions of the intersections of the\nLSS with the faces of the fundamental polyhedron of the finite topology.\nAppreciably greater fluctuations are predicted in these regions.

A complete\nsolution by using, for example, the traditional hyperspherical harmonics (HH)\nbasis develops serious problems due to the large degeneracy of HH basis,\nsymmetrization of the wave function, calculation of the matrix elements, etc.\nfor large $A$. Instead of the HH basis, here we use the \"potential harmonics\"\n(PH) basis, which is a subset of HH basis. We assume that the contribution to\nthe orbital and grand orbital [in $3(A-1)$-dimensional space of the reduced\nmotion] quantum numbers comes only from the interacting pair. This implies\ninclusion of two-body correlations only and disregard of all higher-body\ncorrelations. Such an assumption is ideally suited for the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC), which is extremely dilute. Unlike the $(3A-4)$ hyperspherical\nvariables in HH basis, the PH basis involves only three {\\it{active}}\nvariables. It drastically reduces the number of coupled equations and\ncalculation of the potential matrix becomes tremendously simplified, as it\ninvolves integrals over only three variables for any $A$. One can easily\nincorporate realistic atom-atom interactions in a straight forward manner. We\nstudy the ground and excited state properties of the condensate for both\nattractive and repulsive interactions for various particle number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2004 10:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
