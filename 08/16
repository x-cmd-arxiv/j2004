Although four components, consisting of two of position and\ntwo of velocity, are necessary to determine two-dimensional orbits, the\nvelocity perpendicular to the line of sight can hardly be determined from\nobservations. We show that the ISM orbits can be approximately determined by\nassuming that (1) the angular momentum is conserved along each orbit, (2) all\norbits are closed in a single rotating frame, and (3) the system is symmetric\nthrough the origin. Since the angular momentum can be estimated on the major\naxis of a disk, a velocity perpendicular to the line of sight can be determined\naccording to the conservation of angular momentum, and thus two components of\nvelocity are obtained. The ISM orbits can be calculated by solving differential\nequations given by an obtained two-dimensional velocity field when a certain\npattern speed is given. The typical deviation from the correct orbit is less\nthan the observational resolution according to our test calculations for\nmodeled velocity fields. We applied this method to the observed data of NGC\n4569 and obtained possible orbits for this galaxy. Furthermore, we calculated\nthe mass distribution using our result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 14:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2005 07:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\ntechnique uses measurements with sub-pixel accuracy of the position centroid of\nhigh signal-to-noise long-slit spectrum observations. With the objects in the\nbinary contributing fractionally more or less at different wavelengths\n(particularly across spectral lines), the variation of the position centroid\nwith wavelength provides some information on the spatial distribution of the\nflux. We examine the width of the flux distribution in the spatial direction,\nand present its relation to the ratio of the fluxes of the two components of\nthe binary.

This ratio\ndecreases to only ~23 and 5 for x=0.20 and x=0.4 samples, respectively.\nFurther, the x=0.60 sample shows onset of a broad superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tconset) at around 20 K without achieving the TcR=0 state down to\n2 K. The TcR=0 state is observed in x = 0.80 and 1.00 samples at around 5 and\n14 K, respectively. Thermo-electric power (S), also exhibits TcS~0 state at\naround 11 K and 16 K, respectively for x = 0.8 and 1.00 samples. Thermo\nelectric power at room temperature is positive and decreases with increasing x,\nindicating enhanced number of mobile holes. These results demonstrate that\nsubstitution of Sr at Ba-site systematically induces metallicity and eventually\nsuperconductivity in Y0.4Pr0.6Ba2-xSrxCu3O7 system. The results are explained\non the basis of reduced Pr(4f) orbital hybridization with O(2p) in supercondu\ncting Cu-O2 planes, resulting in delocalization of the mobile carriers. The\nrole of decreased Pr/Ba intermixing disorder is also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 07:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that the Einstein equations\nhold not only at the finitary poset level of `discrete events', but also at a\nsuitable `classical continuum limit' of the said finitary sheaves and the\nassociated differential triads that they define ADG-theoretically. We infer\nthat the law of gravity does not break down in any (differential geometric)\nsense in the vicinity of the locus of the point-mass as the usual manifold\nbased analysis of spacetime singularities in General Relativity has hitherto\nmaintained. Various possible implications that such a total evasion of smooth\ngravitational singularities, as well as some anticipations of the wider\nsignificance that the general ADG-framework, may have for certain current `hot'\nissues in both classical and quantum gravity research are briefly discussed at\nthe end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 14:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 09:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2004 10:37:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2004 15:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2004 14:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2005 11:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A\npopular choice is the gamma family. We consider an example of a clock-like tree\nwith three taxa, one unknown edge length, and a parametric family of scale\nfactor distributions that contain the gamma family. This model has the property\nthat, for a generic choice of unknown edge length and scale factor\ndistribution, there is another edge length and scale factor distribution which\ngenerates data with exactly the same distribution, so that even with infinitely\nmany data it will be typically impossible to make correct inferences about the\nunknown edge length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Aug 2004 20:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2004 14:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This paper describes a class of systems for\nwhich it is possible to reduce this computation to that of finding the norm of\nan associated linear system. In contrast to linearization approaches, a precise\nvalue, not an estimate, is obtained for the full nonlinear model. The class of\nsystems that we study arose from the modeling of certain biological\nintracellular signaling cascades, but the results should be of wider\napplicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 13:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
