After reviewing the theory on the sphere and deriving some\nimportant structure constants, we investigate the boundary states of the theory\nfrom two approaches, one using the modular transformation property of annulus\namplitudes and the other using the bootstrap of disc two-point functions\ncontaining degenerate bulk operators. The boundary interactions describing the\nboundary states are also proposed, based on which the precise correspondence\nbetween boundary states and boundary interactions is obtained. The open string\nspectrum between D-branes is studied from the modular bootstrap approach and\nalso from the reflection relation of boundary operators, providing a\nconsistency check for the proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2004 13:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2006 17:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 14:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
