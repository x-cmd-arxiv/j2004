This unique star was thought to be the smoking gun for the\naction of diffusion, models of which predict a narrow \"Li-peak\" at\napproximately the correct temperature. However, with more detailed studies into\nJ37s abundance pattern this star provides firm evidence for the accretion of\nplanetesimals or other material from the circumstellar environment of new born\nstars.\n  Thanks to the specific predictions made about the behaviour of Be abundances,\n(the most striking of which being no Be in super-Li-rich dwarfs subject to\ndiffusion) the opposing diffusion/accretion predictions can be tested.\n  Initial modelling of the Be line indicates that J37 is as Be rich as it is Li\nrich; log N(Be) = 2.25 +/- 0.25, and so is broadly consistent with an\naccretion-fuelled enhancement. However, that both Li and Be are enhanced by\nmuch more than the iron-peak elements (as determined in previous studies)\nsuggests that diffusion also plays a role in increasing the abundances of Li\nand Be specifically.\n  Furthermore, a new data set from the UVES/UT2 combination has allowed the\nelemental abundance of Iron to be measured, and the set of preliminary stellar\nparameters determined; Teff ~ 7340 K, log g ~ 4.1, microturbulence ~ 4.3 km/s,\n[Fe/H] ~ 0.50. This again provides distinct evidence for the effects of\naccretion in J37 and requires a new synthesis of the Be doublet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2004 13:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Three distinct physical\nprocesses are noted. The characteristic mass for most star formation is\nidentified with the thermal Jeans mass in the molecular cloud core, and this\npresumably leads to the middle mass range by the usual collapse and accretion\nprocesses. Pre-stellar condensations (PSCs) observed in mm-wave continuum\nstudies presumably form at this mass. Significantly smaller self-gravitating\nmasses require much larger pressures and may arise following dynamical\nprocesses inside these PSCs, including disk formation, tight-cluster ejection,\nand photoevaporation as studied elsewhere, but also gravitational collapse of\nshocked gas in colliding PSCs. Significantly larger stellar masses form in\nrelatively low abundance by normal cloud processes, possibly leading to steep\nIMFs in low-pressure field regions, but this mass range can be significantly\nextended in high pressure cloud cores by gravitationally-focussed gas accretion\nonto PSCs and by the coalescence of PSCs.

They accommodate observations ranging from\nshallow IMFs in cluster cores to Salpeter IMFs in average clusters and whole\ngalaxies to steep and even steeper IMFs in field and remote field regions.

The\nfirst one involves the introduction of bi-entangling operations, a class of\nclassically simulatable machines that can generate at most bipartite\nentanglement. Using this class we show that it is possible to sharpen\npreviously obtained upper bounds in certain cases. As an example, we show that\nunder depolarizing noise on the controlled-not gate, the previously known upper\nbound of 74% can be sharpened to around 67%. Another interesting consequence is\nthat measurement based schemes cannot work using only 2-qubit non-degenerate\nprojections. In the second strand of the work we utilize the Gottesman-Knill\ntheorem on the classically efficient simulation of Clifford group operations.\nThe bounds attained for the pi/8 gate using this approach can be as low as 15%\nfor general single gate noise, and 30% for dephasing noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2004 18:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2004 18:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We then investigate whether this\nentanglement can be optimized by allowing the system to interact through a\nweighted combination of the star and the ring geometries. We find that such a\nweighted combination is indeed optimal in certain circumstances for providing\nthe highest entanglement between two chosen spins. The entanglement shows jumps\nand counterintuitive behavior as the relative weighting of the star and the\nring interactions is varied. We give an exact mathematical explanation of the\nbehavior for a five qubit system (four spins in a ring and a central spin) and\nan intuitive explanation for larger systems. For the case of four spins in a\nring plus a central spin, we demonstrate how a four qubit GHZ state can be\ngenerated as a simple derivative of the ground state. Our calculations also\ndemonstrate that some of the multi-particle entangled states derivable from the\nground state of a star network are sufficiently robust to the presence of\nnearest neighbor ring interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2004 19:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Combinatorial schemes for decoupling and\nfor manipulating the couplings of Hamiltonians have been developed which use\nselective pulses. In this paper we consider an additional requirement on these\npulse sequences: as few {\\em different} control operations as possible should\nbe used. This requirement is motivated by the fact that optimizing each\nindividual selective pulse will be expensive, i. e., it is desirable to use as\nfew different selective pulses as possible. For an arbitrary $d$-dimensional\nsystem we show that the ability to implement only two control operations is\nsufficient to turn off the time evolution. In case of a bipartite system with\nlocal control we show that four different control operations are sufficient.\nTurning to networks consisting of several $d$-dimensional nodes which are\ngoverned by a pair-interaction Hamiltonian, we show that decoupling can be\nachieved if one is able to control a number of different control operations\nwhich is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2004 22:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-05"}
