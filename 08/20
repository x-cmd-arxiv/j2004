Together with archival HST images acquired in 2001 these data\nreveal a proper motion of mu = 144.5 +/- 13.2 mas/yr. This implies a relatively\nhigh spatial velocity and indicates that the star is unlikely to be re-heated\nby accretion of matter from the interstellar medium. Assuming that RX\nJ1605.3+3249 is a young (10^5-10^6 yr) cooling neutron star, its apparent\ntrajectory is consistent with a birth in the nearby Sco OB2 OB association at a\nlocation close to that derived for RX J1856.5-3754 and perhaps also to that of\nRX J0720.4-3125. This suggests that the X-ray bright part of ROSAT-discovered\nisolated neutron stars is dominated by the production of the Sco OB2 complex\nwhich is the closest OB association and a part of the Gould belt. The B and R\nmagnitudes of the faint optical counterpart did not vary from 1999 to 2003 at B\n= 27.22 +/- 0.10. Its B-R colour index of +0.32 +/- 0.17 is significantly\nredder than that of other isolated neutron stars and the optical flux lies a\nfactor 11.5 above the extrapolation of the X-ray blackbody-like spectrum. The\nred optical colour reveals the presence of an additional emitting component in\nthe optical regime over the main neutron star thermal emission.

The width of the nebula\nis unresolved and smaller than ~ 0.4\" for a length of about 1\".

We use this basis to\nconstruct the observables O of the quantum mechanics based on H. In particular,\nwe introduce pseudo-Hermitian position and momentum operators and a\npseudo-Hermitian quantization scheme that relates the latter to the ordinary\nclassical position and momentum observables. These allow us to address the\nproblem of determining the conserved probability density and the underlying\nclassical system for pseudo-Hermitian and in particular PT-symmetric quantum\nsystems. As a concrete example we construct the Hermitian Hamiltonian h, the\nphysical observables O, the localized states, and the conserved probability\ndensity for the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric square well. We achieve this by\nemploying an appropriate perturbation scheme. For this system, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of both the kinematical and dynamical effects of the\nnon-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian on various physical quantities. In\nparticular, we show that these effects are quantum mechanical in nature and\ndiminish in the classical limit. Our results provide an objective assessment of\nthe physical aspects of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics and clarify its\nrelationship with both the conventional quantum mechanics and the classical\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2004 09:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
