While\natomic cooling allows star formation in larger primordial objects, such\n\"minihalos\" are generally unable to form stars by themselves. However, the\nlarge population of high-redshift starburst galaxies may have induced\nwidespread star formation in these objects, via shocks that caused intense\ncooling both through nonequilibrium H2 formation and metal-line emission. Using\na simple analytic model, we show that the resulting star clusters naturally\nreproduce three key features of the observed population of halo globular\nclusters (GCs). First, the 10,000 K maximum virial temperature corresponds to\nthe ~ 10^6 solar mass upper limit on the stellar mass of GCs. Secondly, the\nmomentum imparted in such interactions is sufficient to strip the gas from its\nassociated dark matter halo, explaining why GCs do not reside in dark matter\npotential wells. Finally, the mixing of ejected metals into the primordial gas\nis able to explain the ~ 0.1 dex homogeneity of stellar metallicities within a\ngiven GC, while at the same time allowing for a large spread in metallicity\nbetween different clusters. To study this possibility in detail, we use a\nsimple 1D numerical model of turbulence transport to simulate mixing in\ncloud-outflow interactions. We find that as the shock shears across the side of\nthe cloud, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities arise, which cause mixing of enriched\nmaterial into > 20% of the cloud.

Three redshift anomalies are identified in\nthis analysis: (1) Several clusters of galaxies are examined in which late type\nspirals have significant excess redshifts relative to early type spirals in the\nsame clusters, (2) Galaxies of morphology similar to ScI galaxies are found to\nhave a systematic excess redshift relative to the redshifts expected if the\nHubble Constant is 72 km s-1 Mpc-1, (3) individual galaxies, pairs, and groups\nare identified which strongly deviate from the predictions of a smooth Hubble\nflow. These redshift deviations are significantly larger than can be explained\nby peculiar motions and TFR errors. It is concluded that the redshift anomalies\nidentified in this analysis are consistent with previous claims for large\nnon-cosmological (intrinsic) redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2004 12:03:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2004 11:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We quantitatively present the physical information\nextractable from the observable correlation function in deep redshift space in\na framework of the linear theory. The correlation function depends on the\nunderlying power spectrum, velocity distortions, and the Alcock-Paczy\\'nski\n(AP) effect. The underlying power spectrum is sensitive to the constituents of\nmatters in the universe, the velocity distortions are sensitive to the galaxy\nbias as well as the amount of total matter, and the Alcock-Paczy\\'nski effect\nis sensitive to the dark energy components. Measuring the dark energy by means\nof the baryonic feature in the correlation function is one of the most\ninteresting applications. We show that the ``baryon ridge'' in the correlation\nfunction serves as a statistically circular object in the AP effect. In order\nto sufficiently constrain the dark energy components, the redshift range of the\ngalaxy survey should be as broad as possible. The survey area on the sky should\nbe smaller at deep redshifts than at shallow redshifts to keep the number\ndensity as dense as possible.

The\nfractal structure of the flux jumps in our sample shows a stricking similarity\nto that of MgB2 thin film samples, in which magneto-optical experiments have\nrecently shown that the small flux jumps are due to the formation of dendritic\nflux structures. These smaller instabilities act to suppress the critical\ncurrent density of these thin films. The similarity of the flux jump structure\nof our samples suggests that we are also observing the dendritic instability,\nbut in a bulk sample rather than a thin film. This is the first observation of\nthe dendritic instability in a bulk superconducing sample, and is likely due to\nthe layered nature of kappa-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2, which results in a quasi-two\ndimensional flux structure over the majority of it's mixed state phase diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2004 00:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Section 8 gives applications of the Faa di Bruno algebra\nto quantum field theory and Lagrange reversion. Section 9 rederives the related\nConnes-Moscovici algebras. In Part III we turn to the Connes-Kreimer Hopf\nalgebras of Feynman graphs and, more generally, to incidence bialgebras. In\nSection10 we describe the first. Then in Section11 we give a simple derivation\nof (the properly combinatorial part of) Zimmermann's cancellation-free method,\nin its original diagrammatic form. In Section 12 general incidence algebras are\nintroduced, and the Faa di Bruno bialgebras are described as incidence\nbialgebras. In Section 13, deeper lore on Rota's incidence algebras allows us\nto reinterpret Connes-Kreimer algebras in terms of distributive lattices. Next,\nthe general algebraic-combinatorial proof of the cancellation-free formula for\nantipodes is ascertained; this is the heart of the paper. The structure results\nfor commutative Hopf algebras are found in Sections 14 and 15. An outlook\nsection very briefly reviews the coalgebraic aspects of quantization and the\nRota-Baxter map in renormalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2004 00:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2005 14:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2005 18:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Roughly speaking, in the absence of noise, a cheater can only bias\nsignificantly a vanishing fraction of the bits, whereas in the presence of\nnoise, a cheater can bias a constant fraction, with this fraction depending\nquantitatively on the level of noise. We also discuss classical protocols for\nthe same task, deriving upper bounds on how well a classical protocol can\nperform. This enables the determination of how much noise the quantum protocol\ncan tolerate while still outperforming classical protocols.
