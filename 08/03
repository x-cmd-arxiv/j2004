There is an excess of 0.3-2 keV soft X-ray continuum over an\nextrapolation of the hard X-ray power-law, which may arise in a disk corona.\nAnalysis of an archival Chandra image shows that extended emission from the jet\nand other sources contributes <3% of the total X-ray flux.

We have carried out a theoretical study to test whether a large fraction\nof the ULXs, especially those in galaxies with recent star formation activity,\ncan be explained with binary systems containing stellar-mass black holes. To\nthis end, we have applied a unique set of binary evolution models for\nblack-hole X-ray binaries, coupled to a binary population synthesis code, to\nmodel the ULXs observed in external galaxies. We find that for donor stars with\ninitial masses >10 Msun the mass transfer driven by the normal nuclear\nevolution of the donor star is sufficient to potentially power most ULXs. This\nis the case during core hydrogen burning and, to an even more pronounced\ndegree, while the donor star ascends the giant branch, though the latter phases\nlasts only ~5% of the main sequence phase. We show that with only a modest\nviolation of the Eddington limit, e.g., a factor of ~10, both the numbers and\nproperties of the majority of the ULXs can be reproduced. One of our\nconclusions is that if stellar-mass black-hole binaries account for a\nsignificant fraction of ULXs in star-forming galaxies, then the rate of\nformation of such systems is ~3 x 10^{-7} per year normalized to a\ncore-collapse supernova rate of 0.01 per year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2004 20:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We present a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nstellar wind model that produces an outflowing disk and bipolar lobes in a\nsingle, steady-state wind. The basic model consists of a wind from a rotating\nstar with a rotation-axis-aligned dipole magnetic field.

In order to produce wide angle lobes similar to the homunculus\n(which have roughly a 30 degree opening angle), a high-speed polar wind (with\nenhanced energy density) from the star is also required. In that case, the\nstructure of the wind bears a remarkable resemblance to the skirt plus\nhomunculus morphology of the Eta Car nebulae, and a significant fraction of the\nstellar angular momentum is carried away by the wind.

For the [O II] doublet ratio, we find that\nour default atomic data set, consisting of transition probabilities (Aij) from\nZeippen (1982} and collision strengths from Pradhan (1976), fit the\nobservations well, although at high electron densities, the [O II]doublet ratio\nyields densities systematically lower than those given by the [S II] doublet\nratio, suggesting that the ratio of Aij of the [O II]\ndoublet,$A(\\lambda3729)/A(\\lambda3726)$, given by Zeippen (1982) may need to be\nrevised upwards by ~6%. Our analysis also shows that the more recent\ncalculations of [O II] A value by Zeippen (1987a) and collision strengths by\nMcLaughlin & Bell (1998) are inconsistent with the observations at the high and\nlow density limits, respectively, and can therefore be ruled out. We confirm\nthe earlier result of Copetti & Writzl (2002) that the [O II] A values\ncalculated by Wiese et al. (1996) yield electron densities systematically lower\nthan those deduced from the [S II] doublet ratio and that the discrepancy is\nmost likely caused by errors in the A values calculated by Wiese et al.

We found that some parameters of theory like tan beta are\nreparametrization dependent and therefore cannot be fundamental. We use the\nZ2-symmetry of the Lagrangian, which prevents a phi_1 <-> phi_2 transitions,\nand the different levels of its violation, soft and hard, to describe a\nphysical content of the model. In general, the broken Z2-symmetry allows for a\nCP violation in the physical Higgs sector. We argue that the 2HDM with a soft\nbreaking of Z2-symmetry is a natural model in the description of EWSB. To\nsimplify an analysis we choose among different forms of Lagrangian describing\nthe same physical reality a specific one, in which the vacuum expectation\nvalues of both Higgs fields are real. A possible CP violation in the Higgs\nsector is described by using a two-step procedure with the first step identical\nto a diagonalization of mass matrix for CP-even fields in the CP conserved\ncase. We find very simple necessary and sufficient condition for a CP violation\nin the Higgs sector.

By minimizing the grand potential in a\nsimplified schematic model, we find that the proper color-singlet Q-Qbar\npotential can be obtained from the total internal energy U_1 by subtracting the\ngluon internal energy contributions. We carry out this subtraction in the local\nenergy-density approximation in which the gluon energy density can be related\nto the local gluon pressure by the quark-gluon plasma equation of state. We\nfind in this approximation that the proper color-singlet Q-Qbar potential is\napproximately F_1 for T ~ T_c and it changes to (3/4)F_1+(1/4)U_1 at high\ntemperatures.

Seiberg duality can be realized as a sequence of\nPicard-Lefschetz monodromies on 3-cycles in the mirror manifold. In previous\nwork, the precise meaning of gauge theories obtained by monodromies that do not\ncorrespond to Seiberg duality was unclear. Recently, it was pointed out that\nthese theories contain tachyons, suggesting that the collection of marginally\nbound branes at the singularity is unstable. We address this problem using\n(p,q) web techniques. It is shown that theories with tachyons appear whenever\nthe (p,q) web contains crossing legs. A recent study of these theories with\ntachyons using exceptional collections proposed the notion of \"well split\ncondition.'' We show the equivalence between the well split condition and the\nabsence of crossing legs in the (p,q) web. The (p,q) web has a natural\nresolution of crossing legs which was first studied in the construction of five\ndimensional fixed points using branes. Exploiting this result, we propose a\ngeneric procedure which determines the quiver that corresponds to the stable\nbound state of D-branes that live on the singularity after the monodromy. This\nset is generically larger than the original set, meaning that there are extra\nmassless gauge fields and matter fields in the quiver. Alternatively, one can\nargue that since these gauge and matter fields are initially assumed to be\nabsent, the theory exhibits tachyonic excitations. We illustrate our ideas in\nan explicit example for D3-branes on a complex cone over dP1, computing both\nthe quiver and the superpotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2004 18:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2004 20:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We present two studies both using adapted\nmoving frames. In the first study we apply Cartan's method of equivalence to\ninvestigate the geometry underlying a nonholonomic system. As an example we\ncompute the differential invariants for a nonholonomic system on a\nfour-dimensional configuration manifold endowed with a rank two (Engel)\ndistribution. In the second part we study G-Chaplygin systems. These are\nsystems where the constraint distribution is given by a connection on a\nprincipal fiber bundle with total space Q and base space S=Q/G, and with a\nG-equivariant Lagrangian. These systems compress to an almost Hamiltonian\nsystem on $T^{*}S$. Under an $s \\in S$ dependent time reparameterization a\nnumber of compressed systems become Hamiltonian. A necessary condition for\nHamiltonization is the existence of an invariant measure on the original\nsystem. Assuming an invariant measure we describe the obstruction to\nHamiltonization. Chaplygin's \"rubber\" sphere, a ball with unequal inertia\ncoefficients rolling without slipping or spinning (about the vertical axis) on\na plane is Hamiltonizable when compressed to $T^{*}SO(3)$. Finally we discuss\nreduction of internal symmetries. Chaplygin's \"marble\" (where spinning is\nallowed) is not Hamiltonizable when compressed to $T^{*}SO(3)$; we conjecture\nthat it is also not Hamiltonizable when reduced to $T^{*}S^{2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2004 17:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}
