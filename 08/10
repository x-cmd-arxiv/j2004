As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this\nopinion originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct)\nresult obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis\ncarried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary\nequations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some\nof these terms will be nontrivial, in that they will not be amendments to the\ndisturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's\nobliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this\narticle we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We\ndemonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be\nextremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be\nshort-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40\nyears ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second\norder only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession\nmake the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will\nresonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a\nsecular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in the\nsubsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical\nformalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2004 22:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2004 01:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2007 09:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 May 2010 19:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-27"}

We have\nobtained correct phasing between the radio arrival times of the giant pulses\nand the X-ray pulse profile. The giant pulses occur in two phase windows,\nlocated 6.7 ms before and 5.0 ms after the midpoint of the X-ray profile. We\nhave detected the integrated profile of the pulsar at 1.4 GHz with a flux\ndensity of only 24 micro-Jy. The statistics of the giant pulses are clearly\npower-law and it is likely that the giant pulses contribute only a few per cent\nto the integrated pulse flux density, similar to other pulsars with giant pulse\nemission. Simultaneous X-ray and radio observations show no significant\nincrease in the X-ray flux at the time of the radio giants. The relative\nenhancements in the X-ray emission must be at least 5.5 times smaller than in\nthe radio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2004 02:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Recent $^{17}$O NMR for polycrystalline samples of NpO$_{2}$ are\ndiscussed theoretically from our formulation. The observed feature of the\nsplitting of $^{17}$O NMR spectrum into a sharp line and a broad line, their\nintensity ratio, and the magnetic field dependence of the shift and of the\nwidth can be consistently explained on the basis of the triple $\\bq$ AFO\nordering model proposed by Paix\\~{a}o {\\it et. al.} Thus, the present theory\nshows that the $^{17}$O NMR spectrum gives a strong support to the model. The 4\nO sites in the fcc NpO$_2$ become inequivalent due to the secondary triple\n$\\bq$ ordering of AF-quadrupoles: one cubic and three non-cubic sites.

A finite energy density $\\propto T$ of the ground state arises due to\ncaloron interaction.

In this magnetic phase the\nground state is unique and dominates the pressure (negative total pressure).\nWhile the magnetic phase has a massive, propagating 'photon' it confines\nfundamental matter (pre-confinement).

These\nmodels involve the possibility of spontaneous formation of different defensive\nalliances whose members protect each other from the external invaders. The\nMonte Carlo simulations show a surprisingly rich variety of the stable spatial\ndistributions of species and subsequent phase transitions when tuning the\ncontrol parameter Xs. These very simple models are able to demonstrate that the\ncompetition between these associations influences their composition. Sometimes\nthe dominant association is developed via a domain growth. In other cases\nlarger and larger invasion processes preceed the prevalence of one of the\nstable asociations. Under some conditions the survival of all the species can\nbe maintained by the cyclic dominance occuring between these associations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2004 11:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2005 12:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

When the anisotropy coupling is much larger than the\nenergy difference between a defect and an ordinary qubit, the two defects\nbecome strongly entangled. Small anisotropies, on the contrary, may decrease\nthe entanglement, which is, in this case, also much affected by the number of\nexcitations. The analysis is made for nearest neighbor and next-nearest\nneighbor defects. The decrease in the entanglement for nearest neighbor defects\nis not very significant, especially in large chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2004 21:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2005 15:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
