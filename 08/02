The unique mechanisms leading to\nthe huge Raman cross-section enhancement necessary for single molecule\nsensitivity are under intense investigation in several laboratories.

The appearance of the fluctuations in two particular\nvibrational bands, and their dependence on several parameters, suggested that\nthey originate in a charge transfer interaction of an adsorbed molecule with\nthe surface. We argued that the fluctuations are due to variations of the local\nwork function at the position of the molecule. In the current paper the\nfluctuations are further analyzed in terms of the intensity ratio between a\nfluctuating and a quiescent band, and it is found that the distribution of this\nratio is independent of laser power, unlike the correlation time of the\nfluctuations. We show that a simple model, based on the energetics of charge\ntransfer, can be used to extract the local work function distribution from the\nintensity ratio distribution. In a second experiment, single molecule spectra\nare collected from colloids immersed in water and in glycerol and a threefold\ndecrease in fluctuation rate is found in the more viscous fluid. This indicates\nthat surface dynamics are indeed responsible for the fluctuations, involving\nthe motion of the adsorbed molecule and possibly also that of surface silver\natoms around it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2004 10:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
