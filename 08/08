The main result of\nthis paper is a Voronoi-style summation formula for the Fourier coefficients of\na cusp form on GL(3,Z)\\GL(3,R). We also give a treatment of the standard\nL-function on GL(3), focusing on the archimedean analysis as performed using\ndistributions. Finally a new proof is given of the GL(3)xGL(1) converse theorem\nof Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika. This paper is also related to the\nlater papers math.NT/0402382 and math.NT/0404521.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2004 02:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 16:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 May 2007 17:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Therefore, in order to extract meaningful estimates of\nfuture climate change from a model, it is necessary to explore the model'\nuncertainties. In terms of societal impacts of scientific knowledge, it is\nnecessary to accept that any political choice in a matter involving complex\nsystems is made under unavoidable conditions of uncertainty.

Uncertainties in the background generally have smaller effect\non the coverage. A considerable smoothing of the coverage curves is observed.
