Here, I show that formation\nof Earth, from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet, will account for the\ncompression of the rocky Earth to about 64 percent of its current radius,\nyielding a closed, contiguous continental shell with concomitant Earth\nexpansion commencing upon the subsequent removal of its protoplanetary gaseous\nshell. I now propose that Earth expansion progresses, not from spreading at\nmid-oceanic ridges as usually assumed, but primarily by the formation of\nexpansion cracks (often near continental margins) and the in-filling of those\ncracks with basalt (produced from volume expansion in the mantle), which is\nextruded mainly at mid-oceanic ridges, solidifies and traverses the ocean floor\nby gravitational creep to regions of lower gravitational potential energy,\nultimately plunging downward into distant expansion cracks, emulating\nsubduction. Viewed from that perspective, most of the evidence presented in\nsupport of plate tectonics supports Earth expansion; mantle convection is not\nrequired, and the timescale for Earth expansion is no longer constrained to\nabout 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2004 21:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead of phenomenological Doppler-shift\nmethod, we use an approximate analytical solution of Eilenberger equation\ntogether with self-consistent determination of order parameter and a\nvariational treatment of vortex lattice. First, we compare zero-energy density\nof states (ZEDOS) when a magnetic field is applied in the nodal direction\n($\\nu_{node}(0)$) and in the antinodal direction ($\\nu_{anti}(0)$), by taking\naccount of the field-angle dependence of order parameter. As a result, we found\nthat there exists a crossover magnetic field $H^*$ so that $\\nu_{anti}(0) >\n\\nu_{node}(0)$ for $H < H^*$, while $\\nu_{node}(0) > \\nu_{anti}(0)$ for $H >\nH^*$, consistent with our previous analyses. Next, we showed that $H^*$ and the\nshape of FODOS are determined by contribution from the small part of Fermi\nsurface where Fermi velocity is parallel to field-rotational plane. In\nparticular, we found that $H^*$ is lowered and FODOS has broader minima, when a\nsuperconducting gap has point nodes, in contrast to the result of the\nDoppler-shift method. We also studied the effects of in-plane anisotropy of\nFermi surface. We found that in-plane anisotropy of quasi-two dimensional Fermi\nsurface sometimes becomes larger than the effects of Doppler-shift and can\ndestroy the Doppler-shift predominant region. In particular, this tendency is\nstrong in a multi-band system where superconducting coherence lengths are\nisotropic. Finally, we addressed the problem of cusp-like singularity in\nYNi$_2$B$_2$C and present a possible explanation of this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2004 17:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nparticular, the robustness of N-party entanglement is studied in the large N\nlimit when (a) the number of spatially separated subsystems is fixed but the\nsize of each subsystem becomes large (b) the size of the subsystems is fixed\nwhile their number becomes arbitrarily large. We obtain conditions for\nentanglement in these two cases. Among our other results, we show that the\nparity of an entangled state (i.e., whether it contains an even or odd number\nof qubits) can lead to qualitatively different robustness of entanglement under\ncertain conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2004 18:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2004 20:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2005 20:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2005 18:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2005 23:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2005 05:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The saturation of the photon-number correlations is explained\nby the action of non- conservative terms in the CGLE.

An essential\nfeature of this case is the natural appearance of the input constraints and\ninfinite, in general, ``continuous'' state ensembles, defined as probability\nmeasures on the set of all quantum states. By using compactness criteria from\nprobability theory and operator theory it is shown that the set of all\ngeneralized ensembles with the average (barycenter) in a compact set of states\nis itself a compact subset of the set of all probability measures. With this in\nhand we give a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal generalized\nensemble for a constrained quantum channel. This condition can be verified in\nthe case of Bosonic Gaussian channels with constrained mean energy. The\nimportance of the above condition is shown by considering example of a\nconstrained channel with no optimal generalized ensemble. In the case of convex\nconstraints a characterization of the optimal generalized ensemble is obtained\nextending the `` maximal distance'' property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2004 09:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-17"}

As\na specific application, we present a novel protocol for quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) which enhances the BB84 scheme by encrypting the information\nsent over the classical channel during key sifting. We show that, in the limit\nof long keys, this process prevents an eavesdropper from reproducing the\nsifting process carried out by the legitimate users. The inability of the\neavesdropper to sift the information gathered by tapping the quantum channel\nreduces the amount of information that an eavesdropper can gain on the sifted\nkey. We further show that the protocol proposed is self sustaining, and thus\nallows the growing of a secret key.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2004 13:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
