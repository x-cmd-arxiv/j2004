The outer southern lobe of the steep-spectrum radio\nsource appears to be surrounded by a region of cool gas and is at least\npartially surrounded by a bright X-ray rim similar to that seen around radio\nsources in the cores of other cooling flow clusters.

This large range of temperatures (over\na factor of 50) is relatively unique to Abell 2029 and may suggest that this\nsystem is a very young cooling flow where the gas has only recently started\ncooling to low temperatures.

We confirm the bimodality of the color distribution of clusters, even\nin V-I, with peak colors 0.93 and 1.06. The large number of detected clusters\nallows us to evaluate the globular cluster luminosity functions as a function\nof galactocentric radius. We find that the luminosity function of the inner 50%\nof the intermediate-age, metal-rich (`red') population of clusters differs\nmarkedly from that of the outer 50%. In particular, the luminosity function of\nthe inner 50% of the red clusters shows a clear flattening consistent with a\nturnover that is about 1.0 mag fainter than the turnover of the blue clusters.\nThis constitutes the first direct evidence that metal-rich cluster populations\nformed during major mergers of gas-rich galaxies can evolve dynamically\n(through disruption processes) into the red, metal-rich cluster populations\nthat are ubiquitous in `normal' giant ellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2004 15:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2004 16:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is important to\nunderstand what non-linear physics eventually stops the exponential growth of\nunstable modes. It is already known that the initial growth of plasma\ninstabilities in QCD closely parallels that in QED. However, once the unstable\nmodes of the gauge-fields grow large enough for non-Abelian interactions\nbetween them to become important, one might guess that the dynamics of QCD\nplasma instabilities and QED plasma instabilities become very different. In\nthis paper, we give suggestive arguments that non-Abelian self-interactions\nbetween the unstable modes are ineffective at stopping instability growth, and\nthat the growing non-Abelian gauge fields become approximately Abelian after a\ncertain stage in their growth. This in turn suggests that understanding the\ndevelopment of QCD plasma instabilities in the non-linear regime may have close\nparallels to similar processes in traditional plasma physics. We conjecture\nthat the physics of collisionless plasma instabilities in SU(2) and SU(3) gauge\ntheory becomes equivalent, respectively, to (i) traditional plasma physics,\nwhich is U(1) gauge theory, and (ii) plasma physics of U(1)x U(1) gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2004 23:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 15:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-16"}

Pion photoproduction on nuclei is discussed within a chiral\nconstituent quark model in which the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly\nintroduced through an effective chiral Lagrangian for the\nquark-pseudoscalar-meson coupling. The advantage of this model is that a\ncomplete set of nucleon resonances can be systematically included with a\nlimited number of parameters. Also, the systematic description of the nucleon\nand its resonances at quark level allows us to self-consistently relate the\nnuclear medium's influence on the baryon properties to the intrinsic dynamic\naspects of the baryons. As the simplest composite nucleus, the deuteron\nrepresents the first application of this effective theory for meson\nphotoproduction on light nuclei. The influence of the medium on the transition\noperators for a free nucleon is investigated in the Delta resonance region. No\nevidence is found for a change of the Delta properties in the pion\nphotoproduction reaction on the deuteron since the nuclear medium here involves\njust one other nucleon and the low binding energy implies low nuclear density.\nHowever, we show that the reaction mechanism is in principle sensitive to\nchanges of Delta properties that would be produced by the denser nuclear medium\nof heavier nuclei through the modification of the quark model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2004 10:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We derive a\nfamily of classicality criteria that require that averages of positive\nfunctions calculated using $P$-representation must be positive. For polynomial\nfunctions, these criteria are related to 17-th Hilbert's problem, and have\nphysical meaning of generalized squeezing conditions; alternatively, they may\nbe interpreted as {\\it non-classicality witnesses}. We show that every generic\nnon-classical state can be detected by a polynomial that is a sum of squares of\nother polynomials (sos). We introduce a very natural hierarchy of states\nregarding their degree of quantumness, which we relate to the minimal degree of\na sos polynomial that detects them is introduced. Polynomial non-classicality\nwitnesses can be directly measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2004 09:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2005 13:23:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 10:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
