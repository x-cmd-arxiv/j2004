Using simple numerical models, Bournaud, Duc & Masset (2003) claimed\nthat tidal objects as massive as 10^9 Msun could only form, in these\nsimulations, within extended dark matter (DM) haloes. We present here a new set\nof simulations of galaxy collisions to further investigate the structure of\ntidal tails. First of all, we checked that massive objects are still produced\nin full N-body codes that include feedback and a large number of particles.\nUsing a simpler N-body code with rigid haloes, we noticed that dissipation and\nself-gravity in the tails, although important, are not the key factors.\nExploiting toy models, we found that, for truncated DM haloes, material is\nstretched along the tail, while, within extended haloes, the tidal field can\nefficiently carry away from the disk a large fraction of the gas, while\nmaintaining its surface density to a high value. This creates a density\nenhancement near the tip of the tail. Only later-on, self-gravity takes over;\nthe gas clouds collapse and start forming stars. Thus, such objects were\nfundamentally formed following a kinematical process, according to a top-down\nscenario, contrary to the less massive Super Star Clusters that are also\npresent around mergers. This conclusion leads us to introduce a restrictive\ndefinition for Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) and their progenitors, considering\nonly the most massive ones, initially mostly made of gas, that were able to\npile up in the tidal tails. More simulations will be necessary to precisely\ndetermine the fate of these proto--TDGs and estimate their number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 16:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We concentrate on\nthe case when the system's spectrum contains no true bandgap, but only\nsemi-gaps (which are gaps only with respect to one branch of the dispersion\nrelation), that nevertheless support soliton families. Solely zero-velocity\nsolitons were previously studied in this system, while current experiments\ncannot generate solitons with the velocity smaller than half the maximum group\nvelocity. We find the semi-gaps for the moving solitons in an analytical form,\nand demonstrated that they are completely filled with (numerically found)\nsolitons. Stability of the moving solitons is identified in direct simulations.\nThe stability region strongly depends on the frustration parameter, which\ncontrols the difference of the present system from the usual model for the\nsingle BG. A completely new situation is possible, when the velocity interval\nfor stable solitons is limited not only from above, but also from below.\nCollisions between stable solitons may be both elastic and strongly inelastic.\nClose to their instability border, the solitons collide elastically only if\ntheir velocities c1 and c2 are small; however, collisions between more robust\nsolitons are elastic in a strip around c1=-c2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2004 11:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
