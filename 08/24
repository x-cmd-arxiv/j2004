Here a conservative approach is taken where only the\nmost difficult to explain image flux anomalies in strong QSO lenses are\nemphasized. Numerical simulations are performed to compare predictions for the\nLCDM small scale mass function with the observed flux ratios. It is found that\nthe cusp caustic lens anomalies and the disagreements between monochromatic\nflux ratios and simple lens models can be explained without any substructure in\nthe primary lenses' dark matter halos. Extragalactic LCDM halos of mass < 10^9\nMsun are enough to naturally explain these anomalies. This does not mean that\nsubstructure within the host lens is not contributing. In fact, it could\ndominate the lensing depending on how much of substructure survives in the\ncenters of galactic halos.\n  Spectroscopic gravitational lensing provides more information on the nature\nof these substructures. Thus far, the one relevant case in which this technique\nhas been used, observations of Q2237+0305, shows evidence of more small mass\nhalos (~ 10^6 Msun$) than is expected in the LCDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 19:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In a previous paper (Shapiro,\nIliev and Raga 2004), we described this process and presented our results of\nthe first simulations of it by numerical gas dynamics with radiation transport\nin detail. For illustration we focused on the particular case of a 10^7 solar\nmasses minihalo overrun at z=9 by an intergalactic I-front caused by a distant\nsource of ionizing radiation, for different source spectra (either stellar from\nmassive Pop.

In a LambdaCDM universe, minihaloes formed in\nabundance before and during reionization and, thus, their photoevaporation is\nan important, possibly dominant, feature of reionization, which slowed it down\nand wasted ionizing photons. We have now performed a larger set of\nhigh-resolution simulations to determine and quantify the dependence of\nminihalo photoevaporation times and photon consumption rates on halo mass,\nredshift, ionizing flux level and spectrum. We find that the average number of\nionizing photons each minihalo atom absorbs during its photoevaporation is\ntypically in the range 2-10. For the collapsed fraction in minihaloes expected\nduring reionization, this can add about 1 photon per total atom to the\nrequirements for completing reionization, potentially doubling the minimum\nnumber of photons required to reionize the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 19:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The magnitudes of the nuclear starbursts are quantitatively estimated\nfrom the observed 3.3 micron PAH emission luminosities. The estimated starburst\nluminosities relative to some indicators of AGN powers in these Seyfert 1s are\ncompared with 32 Seyfert 2s in the same samples that we have previously\nobserved.

In contrast, however, we find the\nloss of enriched material to be much less efficient when the supernovae occur\nover even a relatively small fraction of the disk.

Our analysis shows that this requirement predicts that the real part\nof the refractive index may be negative in an isotropic medium even if the\nelectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are both positive. Such a\nsystem may be a route to negative index media at optical frequencies. We also\ndemonstrate that the refractive index may be positive in left-handed media that\ncontain two molecular species where one is in its excited state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 17:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The information about a system that can be obtained\nfrom its environment can facilitate quantum control and error correction.\nMoreover, observers gain most of their information indirectly, by monitoring\n(primarily photon) environments of the \"objects of interest.\" Exactly how this\ninformation is inscribed in the environment is essential for the emergence of\n\"the classical\" from the quantum substrate. In this paper, we examine how\nmany-qubit (or many-spin) environments can store information about a single\nsystem. The information lost to the environment can be stored redundantly, or\nit can be encoded in entangled modes of the environment. We go on to show that\nrandomly chosen states of the environment almost always encode the information\nso that an observer must capture a majority of the environment to deduce the\nsystem's state. Conversely, in the states produced by a typical decoherence\nprocess, information about a particular observable of the system is stored\nredundantly. This selective proliferation of \"the fittest information\" (known\nas Quantum Darwinism) plays a key role in choosing the preferred, effectively\nclassical observables of macroscopic systems. The developing appreciation that\nthe environment functions not just as a garbage dump, but as a communication\nchannel, is extending our understanding of the environment's role in the\nquantum-classical transition beyond the traditional paradigm of decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 19:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
