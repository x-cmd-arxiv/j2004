This is not\nshadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable\nrapidities, $y_cm = 1-2$. To study the formation of this effect initial stages\nof relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope\nmodel is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes\ninto account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the\nacceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength\n(string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk\nabout \"string ropes\".

In this paper a variety of such methods is presented with a\ndiscussion of theoretical and computational issues. The problem of finding\nsmall subsurface inclusions from surface scattering data is solved by the\nHybrid Stochastic-Deterministic minimization algorithm. A similar approach is\nused to determine layers in a particle from the scattering data. The Inverse\npotential scattering problem for spherically symmetric potentials and\nfixed-energy phase shifts as the scattering data is described. It is solved by\nthe Stability Index Method. This general approach estimates the size of the\nminimizing sets, and gives a practically useful stopping criterion for global\nminimization algorithms. The 3D inverse scattering problem with fixed-energy\ndata and its solution by the Ramm's method are discussed. An Obstacle Direct\nScattering problem is treated by a Modified Rayleigh Conjecture (MRC) method. A\nspecial minimization procedure allows one to inexpensively compute scattered\nfields for 2D and 3D obstacles having smooth as well as nonsmooth surfaces. A\nnew Support Function Method (SFM) is used for Inverse Obstacle Scattering\nproblems. Another method for Inverse scattering problems, the Linear Sampling\nMethod (LSM), is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 16:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These\nexperimental inputs have been combined with a theoretical model to determine\nthe complex refractive index of the photocathodes in the wavelength range 380\nto 680 nm and their thickness. As a result of this work, we derive a model\nwhich predicts the fraction of light impinging on a photomultiplier tube that\nis reflected, absorbed or transmitted, as a function of wavelength and angle,\nand dependent on the medium to which the photomultiplier is coupled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 11:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
