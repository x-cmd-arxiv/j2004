In this study we systematically investigate how the strong\nmagnetic field and the rapid rotation affect the propagation of the shock\nwaves. Our results show that in the case of the strong initial poloidal\nmagnetic field, the toroidal magnetic field amplified by the differential\nrotation, becomes strong enough to generate a tightly collimated shock wave\nalong the rotational axis. On the other hand, in the case of the weak initial\nmagnetic field, although the differential rotation amplifies toroidal magnetic\nfield over the long rotational period, the launched shock wave is weak and the\nshape of it becomes wider. The former case is expected to be accompanied by the\nformation of the so-called magnetar. Our models with rapid rotation and strong\nmagnetic field can create a nozzle formed by the collimated shock wave. This\nmight be the analogous situation of the collapsar that is plausible for the\ncentral engine of the Gamma-Ray Bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2004 04:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2004 05:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The drag force between the disc\ngas and the embedded planetesimals generally causes the planetesimals to drift\ninwards through the disc at a rate that depends on the particle size. In a\nmarginally stable, self-gravitating disc, however, the planetesimals are\nsignificantly influenced by the non-axisymmetric spiral structures resulting\nfrom the growth of the gravitational instability. For small particles, that are\nstrongly coupled to the disc gas, and for large particles, that have\nessentially decoupled from the disc gas, the effect is not particularly\nsignificant. Intermediate sized particles, which would generally have the\nlargest radial drift rates, do, however, become significantly concentrated at\nthe peaks of the spiral arms. These high density regions may persist for, of\norder, an orbital period and may attain densities comparable to that of the\ndisc gas. Although at the end of the simulation only ~ 25 % of the planetesimal\nparticles lie in regions of enhanced density, during the course of the\nsimulation at least 75 % of the planetesimal particles have at some stage been\nin a such a region. We find that the concentration of particles in the spiral\narms results in an increased collision rate, an effect that could significantly\naccelerate planetesimal growth. The density enhancements may also be sufficient\nfor the growth of planetesimals through direct gravitational collapse. The\ninteraction between small planetesimals and self-gravitating spiral structures\nmay therefore play an important role in the formation of large planetesimals\nthat will ultimately coagulate to form terrestrial planets or the cores of\ngas/ice giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2004 09:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Simulations show\nthe length (width) of the filaments to grow (decay) roughly exponentially, and\nthe incoming finger tips to asymptotically approach a finite radius for n-fold\nsymmetric initial conditions; these thus tend to a stationary-shape, which is\ncalculated. The filament width decays with a time constant which depends only\non the viscosity contrast, whereas its length exhibits a completely universal\ngrowth rate, related to the run away of an isolated droplet, for which we give\nan exact solution.

The target system\nthat is to be remotely controlled is first entangled with another identical\nsystem, called the control system. The control system is then subjected to\nunitary transformations plus projective measurement. As anticipated by\nSchrodinger, such control via entanglement is necessarily probabilistic in\nnature. On the other hand, under appropriate conditions the remote-control\nscenario offers the special advantages of robustness against decoherence and a\ngreater repertoire of unitary transformations. Simulations carried out for a\ntwo-level system demonstrate that, with optimization of control parameters, a\nsubstantial gain in the population of reachable states can be realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2004 21:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2005 21:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
