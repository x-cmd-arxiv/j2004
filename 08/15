These moons are\nthought to have been captured into planetocentric orbits after straying into a\nregion in which the planet's gravitation dominates solar perturbations (the\nHill sphere). This mechanism requires a source of dissipation, such as\ngas-drag, in order to make capture permanent. However, capture by gas-drag\nrequires that particles remain inside the Hill sphere long enough for\ndissipation to be effective. Recently we have proposed that in the circular\nrestricted three-body problem particles may become caught up in `sticky'\nchaotic layers which tends to prolong their sojourn within the planet's Hill\nsphere thereby assisting capture. Here we show that this mechanism survives\nperturbations due to the ellipticity of the planet's orbit. However, Monte\nCarlo simulations indicate that the planet's ability to capture moons decreases\nwith increasing orbital eccentricity. At the actual Jupiter's orbital\neccentricity, this effects in approximately an order of magnitude lower capture\nprobability than estimated in the circular model. Eccentricities of planetary\norbits in the Solar System are moderate but this is not necessarily the case\nfor extrasolar planets which typically have rather eccentric orbits. Therefore,\nour findings suggest that these extrasolar planets are unlikely to have\nsubstantial populations of irregular moons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2004 17:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In agreement with previous studies, we find that\nthe radial distribution of subhalos is significantly less concentrated than\nthat of the dark matter, when subhalos are selected using their present-day\ngravitationally bound mass. We show that the difference in the radial\ndistribution is not a numerical artifact and is due to tidal stripping. The\nsubhalos in the cluster core lose more than 70% of their initial mass since\naccretion, while the average tidal mass loss for halos near the virial radius\nis ~30%. This introduces a radial bias in the spatial distribution of subhalos\nwhen they are selected using their tidally truncated mass. We demonstrate that\nthe radial bias disappears almost entirely if subhalos are selected using their\nmass or circular velocity at the accretion epoch. The comparisons of the\nresults of dissipationless simulations to the observed distribution of galaxies\nin clusters are therefore sensitive to the selection criteria used to select\nsubhalo samples. Using the simulations that include cooling and starformation,\nwe show that the radial distribution of subhalos is in reasonable agreement\nwith the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters for\n0.1<R/R200<2.0, if subhalos are selected using the stellar mass of galaxies.\nThe radial bias is minimized in this case because the stars are located in the\ncenters of dark matter subhalos and are tightly bound. The stellar mass of an\nobject is therefore approximately conserved as the dark matter is stripped from\nthe outer regions. Nevertheless, the concentration of the radial distribution\nof galaxies is systematically lower than that of the dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2004 21:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
