Pairs of\ndegenerate photons at telecom wavelength are created by parametric down\nconversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. The photon pairs\nare separated in a beam-splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25km. The\nwave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,\nforming a large Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Coincidence counts between the\nphotons at the two output modes are registered. The main challenge consists in\nthe trade-off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length\nfluctuations of the 25km long arms during the measurement. For balanced paths a\nHong-Ou-Mandel dip with a visibility of 47.3% is observed, which is close to\nthe maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here. This proves the\npracticability of a long distance Bell state measurement with two independent\nsources, as e.g. required in an entanglement swapping configuration in the\nscale of tens of km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2004 16:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2005 10:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2005 15:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-23"}
