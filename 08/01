We find\nthat the APM counts in both the B and K-bands indicate a deficiency in the\nlocal galaxy distribution of approx. 30% to z=0.1 over the entire APM survey\narea. We examine the implied significance of such a large local hole,\nconsidering several possible forms for the real-space correlation function. We\nfind that such a deficiency in the APM survey area indicates an excess of power\nat large scales over what is expected from the correlation function observed in\nthe 2dFGRS correlation function or predicted from $\\Lambda$CDM Hubble Volume\nmock catalogues. In order to check further the clustering at large scales in\nthe 2MASS data, we have calculated the angular power spectrum for 2MASS\ngalaxies. Although in the linear regime (l<30), LCDM models can give a good fit\nto the 2MASS angular power spectrum, over a wider range (l<100) the power\nspectrum from Hubble Volume mock catalogues suggests that scale-dependent bias\nmay be needed for LCDM to fit. However, the modest increase in large-scale\npower observed in the 2MASS angular power spectrum is still not enough to\nexplain the local hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2004 17:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This allows for true parallel plate shear with minimal\ninterference from the containing geometry. The motions of the side walls also\nallow for a direct measurement of the velocity profile across the granular\npack. Results are presented for applying this system to the study of transients\nin granular shear and for shear-induced crystallization.
