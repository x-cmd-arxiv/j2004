We argue that the spatial\ndistribution and the kinematics of the various types of galaxies in and outside\nsubstructures support the following picture.\n  The ELLIPTICAL AND S0 GALAXIES have been around for a long time and have\nobtained an isotropic velocity distribution. The spatial distribution and\nkinematics of the EARLY SPIRALS are consistent with the idea that many of their\nkind have transformed into an S0, but that they have survived, most likely\nbecause of their velocities. The distribution and kinematics of the LATE\nSPIRALS are consistent with a picture in which they have been accreted fairly\nrecently. They have mildly radial orbits and hardly populate the central\nregions, most likely because they suffer tidal disruption. Finally, the\ndistribution and kinematics of the GALAXIES IN SUBSTRUCTURES, when taken at\nface value, imply tangential velocity anisotropy for these galaxies, but this\nresult may be (partly) due to the procedure by which these galaxies are\nselected.

Corneal thickness and elevation maps are shown.\nConclusions: Although still under development, this new optical system allows\nthe measurement of the thickness of the whole cornea as well as 3-D mapping of\nboth corneal surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 May 2004 13:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 10:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The spectral control offered by this technique\npermits one to choose the operating wavelengths for each photon of a pair based\non optimizations of other system parameters (loss in optical fiber, photon\ncounter performance, etc.). The combination of spectral control, polarization\ncontrol, and lack of group-velocity matching conditions makes this technique\nparticularly well-suited for a distributed quantum information processing\narchitecture in which integrated optical circuits are connected by spans of\noptical fiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 19:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}
