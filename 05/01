We introduce the concept of the reality\ncondition, according to which the entropy $S(T)$ of a set of coupled degrees of\nfreedom must be non-negative. The entropy crisis, which does not affect\nstability, is identified as the violation of the reality condition. We identify\nand validate rigorously, using general thermodynamic arguments, the following\ngeneral thermodynamic mechanism behind the entropy crisis in SMS. The free\nenergy $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ of any SMS must be equal to the T=0 crystal free\nenergy $E_{0}$ at two different temperatures $T=0,$ and $T=T_{\\text{eq}}>0$.\nThus, the stability requires $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ to possess a maximum at an\nintermediate but a strictly positive temperature $T_{\\text{K}},$ where the\nenergy is $E=E_{\\text{K}}.$ The SMS branch below $T_{\\text{K}}$ gives the\nentropy crisis and must be replaced by hand by an ideal glass free energy of\nconstant energy $E_{\\text{K}},$ and vanishing entropy. Hence, $T_{\\text{K}}>0$\nrepresents the Kauzmann temperature. The ideal glass energy $E_{\\text{K}}$ is\nhigher than the crystal energy $E_{0}$ at absolute zero, which is in agreement\nwith the experimenatal fact that the extrapolated energy of a real glass at T=0\nis higher than its T=0 crystal energy.

It is found that the skewness of the transverse\nderivative shows a different decay behavior with respect to Reynolds number\nwhen the sequence of simulation runs follows different pathways across the\ntwo-parameter plane. The study can shed new light on different interpretations\nof the decay of odd order moments in high-Reynolds number experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 May 2004 08:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2004 07:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
