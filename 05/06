In the present paper we will discuss the effect of\nneutralino annihilation in the halo of our Galaxy and in its center. According\nto high resolution cold dark matter simulations, large virialized halos are\nformed through the constant merging of smaller halos appeared at previous\ntimes. At each epoch, dark matter halos have then a clumpy component which is\nmade of these merging subhalos. The annihilation of dark matter in these\nclumps, always present in the halo of our Galaxy, may be responsible for\nappreciable fluxes of $\\gamma$-rays, potentially detectable.

It is used to study the effects of geometric\nobstruction on mobile fermions in thermodynamic equilibrium. For low hopping\noverlap, there appears a plateau in the entropy, due to charge correlations,\nand related to real-space disorder. For large overlap, the equilibrium\nthermopower susceptibility remains anomalous, with a sign opposite to the one\npredicted from the single-particle density of states. The heat capacity and\nnon-Fermi liquid response are discussed in the context of similar results in\nthe literature. All results are obtained by evaluation of an effective\nsingle-particle free-energy operator in closed form. The method to obtain this\noperator is described in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2004 14:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2004 14:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the overlap framework, the\ncomputation of the fermion propagator leads to a nested iteration where the\nmatrix vector multiplications in each step of an outer iteration have to be\naccomplished by an inner iteration; the latter approximates the product of the\nsign function of the hermitian Wilson fermion matrix with a vector. In this\npaper we investigate aspects of this nested paradigm. We examine several Krylov\nsubspace methods to be used as an outer iteration for both propagator\ncomputations and the Hybrid Monte-Carlo scheme. We establish criteria on the\naccuracy of the inner iteration which allow to preserve an a priori given\nprecision for the overall computation. It will turn out that the accuracy of\nthe sign function can be relaxed as the outer iteration proceeds. Furthermore,\nwe consider preconditioning strategies, where the preconditioner is built upon\nan inaccurate approximation to the sign function. Relaxation combined with\npreconditioning allows for considerable savings in computational efforts up to\na factor of 4 as our numerical experiments illustrate.

One issue discussed is the use of QCD inequalities\nfor this regime. In particular, the positivity of the integrand of particular\nEuclidean space functional integrals for two-flavor QCD with degenerate quark\nmasses is used to demonstrate that the free energy per unit volume for QCD with\na baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ (and zero isospin chemical potential) is\nnecessarily greater than the free energy with isospin chemical potential $\\mu_I\n= \\frac{2 \\mu_B}{N_c} $ (and zero baryon chemical potential). This result may\nbe of use in model finite density systems. A corollary to this result is a\nrigorous {\\it ab initio} bound on the nucleon mass. The second major issue\naddressed is the so-called ``Silver Blaze'' problem: the fact that at zero\ntemperature and chemical potentials less than some critical value the free\nenergy remains as that of the vacuum. This is puzzling in the context of a\nfunctional integral since a chemical potential affects the functional\ndeterminant of the Dirac operator and any nonzero $\\mu$ changes every\neigenvalue of the Dirac operator compared to the $\\mu=0$ value. The isospin\nSilver Blaze problem is solved through the study of the spectrum of the\noperator $\\gamma_0 (\\dslash + m)$.
