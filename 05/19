The velocity field of the spiral motion,\nsuperposed on the background Keplerian flow, results in a complicated redshift\ndistribution in the accretion disk. An X-ray source attributed to a localized\nflaring region on the black hole symmetry axis illuminates the iron in the\ndisk. The emissivity form becomes very steep because of the light bending\neffect from the primary X-ray source to the disk. The predicted line profile is\ncalculated for various spiral waves, and we found, regardless of the source\nheight, that: (i) a multiple-peak along with a classical double-peak structure\ngenerally appears, (ii) such a multiple-peak can be categorized into two types,\nsharp sub-peaks and periodic spiky peaks, (iii) a tightly-packed spiral wave\ntends to produce more spiky multiple peaks, whereas (iv) a spiral wave with a\nlarger amplitude seems to generate more sharp sub-peaks, (v) the effect seems\nto be less significant when the spiral wave is centrally concentrated, (vi) the\nline shape may show a drastic change (forming a double-peak, triple-peak or\nmultiple-peak feature) as the spiral wave rotates with the disk. Our results\nemphasize that around a rapidly-rotating black hole an extremely redshifted\niron line profile with a noticeable spike-like feature can be realized in the\npresence of the spiral wave. Future X-ray observations, from {\\it Astro-E2} for\nexample, will have sufficient spectral resolution for testing our spiral wave\nmodel which exhibits unique spike-like features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 19:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

Single crystals were grown by the traveling-solvent floating-zone method\nat 18 La/Sr concentrations. The low-temperature phase diagram can be understood\nby considering the strong coupling of the magnetic and orbital degrees of\nfreedom, and it can be divided into three distinct regions: low (x < 0.12),\nintermediate (0.12< x < 0.45), and high (x > 0.45) doping. LaSrMnO_4 (x=0) is\nan antiferromagnetic Mott insulator,and its spin-wave spectrum is\nwell-described by linear spin-wave theory for the spin-2 square-lattice\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian with Ising anisotropy. Upon doping, as the e_g electron\nconcentration (1-x) decreases, both the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin\ncorrelations in the paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ordered moment\ndecrease due to an increase of frustrating interactions, and Neel order\ndisappears above xc = 0.115(10). In the intermediate region, there exists\nneither long-range magnetic nor superstructural order. Short-range-correlated\nstructural \"nanopatches\" begin to form above x ~ 0.25. At high doping (x >\n0.45), the ground state of La{1-x}Sr{1+x}MnO4 exhibits long-range\nsuperstructural order and a complex (CE-type) antiferromagnetic order which\ndiffers from that at low doping. The superstructural order is thought to arise\nfrom charge and orbital ordering on the Mn sites. For x > 0.50, the\nsuperstructural order becomes incommensurate with the lattice, with a\nmodulation wavevector that depends linearly on the e_g electron concentration.\nOn the other hand, the magnetic order remains commensurate, but loses its\nlong-range coherence upon doping beyond x = 0.50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 23:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We study theoretically the manifestation of\nthis effect in the dc response to the combined action of two driving ac-fields\n(bichromatic irradiation). Compared to the case of monochromatic irradiation,\nwhich is currently intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically,\nthe presence of a second microwave source provides additional insight into the\nproperties of an ac-driven 2D electron gas. In particular, we find that\nnonparabolicity, being the simplest cause for a violation of Kohn's theorem,\ngives rise to new qualitative effects specific to bichromatic irradiation.\nNamely, when the frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are well away from the\ncyclotron frequency, $\\omega_c$, our simple classical considerations\ndemonstrate that the system becomes parametrically unstable with respect to\nfluctuations with frequency $(\\omega_1+\\omega_2)/2$. As an additional effect of\nnonparabolicity, this parametric instability can manifest itself in the dc\nproperties of the system. This happens when $\\omega_1$, $\\omega_2$ and\n$\\omega_c$ are related as 3:1:2, respectively. Even for weak detuning between\n$\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, the effect of the bichromatic irradiation on the dc\nresponse in the presence of nonparabolicity can differ dramatically from the\nmonochromatic case. In particular, the equations of motion can acquire\nmultistable solutions. As a result, the diagonal dc-conductivity can assume\nseveral stable negative values at the same magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 15:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

An example -- supported by Weinberg's successful prediction of the\ncosmological constant -- is the potentially vast landscape of vacua in string\ntheory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum\nselection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and\nsupersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the\nunification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems. High-scale SUSY breaking raises the\nmass of the light Higgs to about 120-150 GeV. The gluino is strikingly long\nlived, and a measurement of its lifetime can determine the ultraheavy scalar\nmass scale. Measuring the four Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to the gauginos\nand higgsinos precisely tests for high-scale SUSY. These ideas, if confirmed,\nwill demonstrate that supersymmetry is present but irrelevant for the hierarchy\nproblem -- just as it has been irrelevant for the cosmological constant problem\n-- strongly suggesting the existence of a fine-tuning mechanism in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 19:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2004 20:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Diffraction\nsets the lower limit to the transverse dimensions of electromagnetic beams and\nrepresents a fundamental obstacle for electromagnetic heating of small or\ninaccessible regions. It was found, however, that it is possible to achieve\nefficient heating of cylindrical targets by electromagnetic beams with\ntransverse dimensions that are several orders of magnitude greater than those\nof the cylinder. These counter-intuitive results have the following physical\nmechanism: the absorption in the cylinder causes a deep fall in the field\ndistribution, and this fall causes diffractive diffusion of the field towards\nthe axis from a large volume of the beam. The heating efficiency was rigorously\ncalculated using the exact solution of the problem of diffraction on an\ninfinite homogeneous cylinder (J.R. Wait, 1955). Several non-resonant domains\nof parameters were found that provide efficient absorption of the energy of a\nbroad beam in a thin conducting cylinder. The typical asymptotic efficiency for\nvery thin cylinders is (2-5)/L, where L=ln(w/d), where d is the diameter of the\ncylinder and w is the width of the beam waist in the longitudinal geometry or\nthe wavelength in the transverse geometry. This efficiency is high even if the\nbeam is several orders of magnitude broader than the cylinder. The relevant\nconditions are not too rigid and may be used to heat cylindrical targets to\nhigh temperatures in a number of important applications. External magnetic\nfield may further relax the conditions of efficient heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 16:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Using this criterion, we can judge completely whether or not the\nstate $\\rho $ is equivalent to the maximally correlated state, in which the\ndistillable entanglement is given by a simple formula. For generalized Bell\nstates, this criterion is written as a simple algebraic relation between\nindices of the states.
