The mechanism for energy loss is thermal diffusion caused by\ninhomogeneous deformation, flexure in thin plates. The general result is\ncombined with the Kirchhoff assumption to obtain a new equation for the\nflexural vibration of thin plates incorporating thermoelastic loss as a damping\nterm. The thermal relaxation loss is inhomogeneous and depends upon the local\nstate of vibrating flexure, specifically, the principal curvatures at a given\npoint on the plate. Thermal loss is zero at points where the principal\ncurvatures are equal and opposite, that is, saddle shaped or pure anticlastic\ndeformation. Conversely, loss is maximum at points where the curvatures are\nequal, that is, synclastic or spherical flexure. The influence of modal\nurvature on the thermoelastic damping is described through a modal\npparticipation factor.

It is shown that transverse diffusion effects are\nalways small provided the plate thickness is far greater than the thermal\nphonon mean free path, a requirement for the validity of the classical theory\nof heat transport.

We show that the `Shale map' respects compositions (This\nsettles an old conjecture of K. R. Parthasarathy). Using this we associate a\nproduct system to a sum system. This construction includes the exponential\nproduct system of Arveson, as a trivial case, and the type III examples of\nTsirelson.\n  By associating a von Neumann algebra to every `elementary set' in [0,1], in a\nmuch simpler and direct way, we arrive at the invariants of the product system\nintroduced by Tsirelson, given in terms of the sum system. Then we introduce a\nnotion of divisibility for a sum system, and prove that the examples of\nTsirelson are divisible. It is shown that only type I and type III product\nsystems arise out of divisible sum systems. Finally, we give a sufficient\ncondition for a divisible sum system to give rise to a unitless (type III)\nproduct system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 May 2004 10:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}
