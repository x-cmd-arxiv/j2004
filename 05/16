The only requirement is that\na significant relativistic component, in the form of cosmic rays (CR), be\npresent in the intra-cluster medium and significantly frozen to the thermal\ngas. Such an addition qualitatively alters the conventional isobaric thermal\ninstability criterion such that a fluid parcel becomes thermally stable when\nits thermal pressure drops below a threshold fraction of its CR pressure.\nConsequently, the lowest possible temperature at any radius is about one third\nof the ambient temperature {\\it at that radius}, exactly as observed, In\naddition, we suggest that dissipation of internal gravity waves, excited by\nradial oscillatory motions of inward drifting cooling clouds about their radial\nequilibrium positions, may be responsible for heating up cooling gas. With the\nultimate energy source for powering the cooling X-ray luminosity and heating up\ncooling gas being gravitational due to inward drifting cooling clouds as well\nas the general inward flow, heating is spatially distributed and energetically\nmatched with cooling. One desirable property of this heating mechanism is that\nheating energy is strongly centrally concentrated, providing the required\nheating for emission-line nebulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 2004 01:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The measured observables of Altair showed two features\nwhich are inconsistent with both the uniform-disk and limb-darkened disk\nmodels, while the measured observable of the comparison star, Vega, are\nconsistent with the limb-darkened disk model. The first feature is that\nmeasured squared visibility amplitudes at the first minimum do not reach 0.0\nbut rather remain at about 0.02, indicating the existence of a small bright\nregion on the stellar disk. The other is that the measured closure phases show\nnon-zero/180 degrees at all spectral channels, which requires an asymmetric\nsurface brightness distribution.
