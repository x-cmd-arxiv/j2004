In addition to the rapid X-ray variability, the short UV light\ncurves (< 4 hours) obtained with the Optical Monitor may also show\nfluctuations, albeit at much lower amplitude than the X-rays. In general, the\nextreme variability is impressive considering that the broad-band (0.4-10 keV\nrest-frame) luminosity of the source is ~10^45 erg/s. During at least one of\nthe observations, the X-ray and UV light curves show common trends, although\ngiven the short duration of the OM observations, and low significance of the UV\nlight curves it is difficult to comment on the importance of this possible\ncorrelation. Interestingly, the high-energy photons (> 2 keV) do not appear\nhighly variable. The X-ray spectrum resembles that of many narrow-line Seyfert\n1 type galaxies: an intense soft-excess modelled with a multi-colour disc\nblackbody, a power-law component, and an absorption line at ~1.4 keV. The ~1.4\nkeV feature is curious given that it was not detected in previous observations,\nand its presence could be related to the strength of the soft-excess. Of\nfurther interest is curvature in the spectrum above ~2 keV which can be\ndescribed by a strong reflection component.

But in the \\textit{absence} of full\n($+, -$) ion symmetry, density and charge fluctuations mix via a transparent\nmechanism: then the screening \\textit{at criticality} is \\textit{weaker} by a\nfactor $r^{4-2\\eta}$. Furthermore, the otherwise valid Stillinger-Lovett sum\nrule fails \\textit{at} criticality whenever $\\eta =0$ (as, e.g., when\n$\\sigma>2$) although it remains valid if $\\eta >0$ (as for $\\sigma<2$ or in\nreal $d \\leq 3$ Ising-type systems).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2004 18:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The theory describes leading-order\nnonlinear response of the microions (counterions, salt ions) to the\nelectrostatic potential of the macroions and predicts microion-induced\neffective many-body interactions between macroions. A linear response\napproximation [Phys. Rev. E 62, 3855 (2000)] yields an effective pair potential\nof screened-Coulomb (Yukawa) form, as well as a one-body volume energy, which\ncontributes to the free energy. Nonlinear response generates effective\nmany-body interactions and essential corrections to both the effective pair\npotential and the volume energy. By adopting a random-phase approximation (RPA)\nfor the response functions, and thus neglecting microion correlations,\npractical expressions are derived for the effective pair and triplet potentials\nand for the volume energy. Nonlinear screening is found to weaken repulsive\npair interactions, induce attractive triplet interactions, and modify the\nvolume energy. Numerical results for monovalent microions are in good agreement\nwith available ab initio simulation data and demonstrate that nonlinear effects\ngrow with increasing macroion charge and concentration and with decreasing salt\nconcentration. In the dilute limit of zero macroion concentration,\nleading-order nonlinear corrections vanish. Finally, it is shown that nonlinear\nresponse theory, when combined with the RPA, is formally equivalent to the\nmean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory and that the linear response approximation\ncorresponds, within integral-equation theory, to a linearized hypernetted-chain\nclosure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2004 19:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The theory is constructed in a\nflat background spacetime and employs gauge fields to ensure that all relations\nbetween physical quantities are independent of the positions and orientations\nof the matter fields. In this manner all properties of the background spacetime\nare removed from physics, and what remains are a set of `intrinsic' relations\nbetween physical fields. The properties of the gravitational gauge fields are\nderived from both classical and quantum viewpoints. Field equations are then\nderived from an action principle, and consistency with the minimal coupling\nprocedure selects an action that is unique up to the possible inclusion of a\ncosmological constant. This in turn singles out a unique form of spin-torsion\ninteraction. A new method for solving the field equations is outlined and\napplied to the case of a time-dependent, spherically-symmetric perfect fluid. A\ngauge is found which reduces the physics to a set of essentially Newtonian\nequations. These equations are then applied to the study of cosmology, and to\nthe formation and properties of black holes. The existence of global solutions\nenables one to discuss the properties of field lines inside the horizon due to\na point charge held outside it. The Dirac equation is studied in a black hole\nbackground and provides a quick derivation of the Hawking temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 May 2004 16:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Space-time diffeomorphisms that\nleave the string world-sheet invariant appear as gauge transformations on the\nnormal bundle of the world-sheet. The naive invariance of the model under such\ntransformations is however explicitly broken by anomalies: The electromagnetic\ncoupling of the string to the two-form gauge field of the tensor multiplet\nsuffers from a classical anomaly, and there is also a one-loop quantum anomaly\nfrom the chiral fermions on the string world-sheet. Both of these contributions\nare proportional to the Euler class of the normal bundle of the string\nworld-sheet, and consistency of the model requires that they cancel. This\nimposes strong constraints on possible models, which are found to obey an\nADE-classification. We then consider the decoupled world-sheet theory that\ndescribes low-energy fluctuations (compared to the scale set by the string\ntension) around a configuration with a static, straight string.

The game has many equilibria, and which of them is reached depends\non the history of the interactions as the players evolve according to a fitness\nfunction that measures their gains across the interactions. We can then break\nthe symmetry by assigning different strategy spaces to the populations, varying\nin particular with respect to the information available to the agents.

Then, we\ndeal with the geological methods used to characterise or to plan a seismic\nstation deployment in a few cases. Last, we define the gain of the network as\nthe percentage of located earthquakes with respect to the total recorded\nearthquakes. By analysing the distribution of non-located (\"missed\")\nearthquakes, we suggest possible actions to take in order to increase the gain.\nResults show that completeness magnitude is 2.4 in the average over the\nanalysed period, and it can be as low as 2.2 when we consider non-located\nearthquakes as well. Parameters such as the distance between an earthquake and\nthe closest station, and the RMS location decrease with time, reflecting\nimprovements in the location quality. Methods for geologic and seismological\ncharacterisation of a possible station site also proved to be effective.\nFinally, we represent the number of missed earthquakes at each station, showing\nthat nine stations control more that 50% of all missed earthquakes, and\nsuggesting areas in Italy where the network might be easily improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2004 11:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthis normal fluid flow the effects of mutual friction excitation from the\nsuperfluid vortices and those of viscous stresses are of the same order.

Motivated in part by the need to identify sequence\ncharacteristics that indicate a tendency to aggregate, we introduce a general\nmethod that probes covariations in charged residues along the sequence in a\ngiven protein family. The method, which involves computing the Sequence\nCorrelation Entropy (SCE) using the quenched probability Psk(i,j) of finding a\nresidue pair at a given sequence separation sk, allows us to classify protein\nfamilies in terms of their SCE.
