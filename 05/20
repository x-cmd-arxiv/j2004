The model predicts two phases or states dictated by the photon\nupscattering produced in the TL: (1) hard state, in which the TL is optically\nthin and very hot (kT ~ 50 keV) producing photon upscattering via thermal\nComponization; the photon spectrum index Gamma~1.7 for this state is dictated\nby gravitational energy release and Compton cooling in an optically thin shock\nnear the adjustment radius; (2) a soft state which is optically thick and\nrelatively cold (kT~5 keV); the index for this state, Gamma~2.8 is determined\nby soft-photon upscattering and photon trapping in converging flow into BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 19:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A non-linear kinetic system with conservation of supports\nfor distributions has generically finite-dimensional asymptotics. Such systems\nare apparent in many areas of biology, physics (the theory of parametric wave\ninteraction), chemistry and economics. This conservation of support has a\nbiological interpretation: inheritance. The finite-dimensional asymptotics\ndemonstrates effects of \"natural\" selection. Estimations of the asymptotic\ndimension are presented. After some initial time, solution of a kinetic\nequation with conservation of support becomes a finite set of narrow peaks that\nbecome increasingly narrow over time and move increasingly slowly. It is\npossible that these peaks do not tend to fixed positions, and the path covered\ntends to infinity as t goes to infinity. The drift equations for peak motion\nare obtained. Various types of distribution stability are studied: internal\nstability (stability with respect to perturbations that do not extend the\nsupport), external stability or uninvadability (stability with respect to\nstrongly small perturbations that extend the support), and stable realizability\n(stability with respect to small shifts and extensions of the density peaks).\nModels of self-synchronization of cell division are studied, as an example of\nselection in systems with additional symmetry.

In this paper we discuss whether\nevidence for the sextet sector could be seen at the Tevatron.\n  A major consequence of the connection between QCD and electroweak symmetry\nbreaking is the strong coupling of the pomeron to the electroweak sector. At\nthe Tevatron, the energy is too low to produce vector boson pairs directly via\ndouble pomeron exchange, but a number of small cross-section effects could be\nseen in diffractive, and diffractive related, processes involving $W^{\\pm}$ and\n$Z^0$ vector bosons. Probably, the most important feature that could be\ndecisively established is that the production cross-section for $W^+W^-$ and\n$Z^0Z^0$ pairs has an anomalous component with event characteristics different\nfrom the Standard Model. This would be the first indication of what should\nbecome a dominant, very large, cross-section at the LHC.\n  If the sextet quark dynamical mass scale is well above the top quark mass,\nthen the production properties of $W$'s and $Z$'s could be the only new physics\nvisible at the Tevatron scale. If this scale is lower the situation could be\nmore subtle. The observed $t\\bar{t}$ events could originate from the $\\eta_6$ -\nthe ``sextet higgs'', even though they can be understood perturbatively. The\ninterpretation of the top quark mass would, however, be different and\nnon-perturbative decay modes should also be seen. A jet excess at large $E_T$\nwould provide supporting evidence for this picture, since $\\alpha_s$ evolution\nshould stop at $E_T \\sim$ ``$m_{top}$''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 18:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Integrable structures have appeared in both planar N=4\nsuper Yang-Mills theory and type IIB superstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5. A\ngeneralized statement of the AdS/CFT conjecture has therefore emerged in which,\nin addition to string energies corresponding to gauge theory anomalous\ndimensions, an infinite tower of higher charges on each side of the duality\nshould also be equated. Demonstrations of this larger equivalence have been\nsuccessful in certain regimes. To test this correspondence in a more stringent\nsetting, the bosonic sector of the fully quantized string theory on AdS_5 x S^5\nis expanded about the pp-wave limit to sextic order in fields, or to O(1/J^2),\nwhere J is the (large) angular momentum of string states boosted along an\nequatorial geodesic in the S^5 subspace.
