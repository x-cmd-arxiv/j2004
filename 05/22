Recently, Fuchs (2002) has attempted such a disentanglement using\nspiral arm density wave and swing amplification theory, allowing an independent\nmeasurement of the disc mass; this work suggests that LSB discs are\nsignificantly more massive than previously believed.

Unfortunately, there are often\nmany possible models that are observationally equivalent. Here we show that the\nsituation is not as arbitrary as one would think. We show that generators of\nhidden stochastic processes can be reduced to a minimal form and compare this\nreduced representation to that provided by computational mechanics--the\nepsilon-machine. On the way to developing deeper, measure-theoretic foundations\nfor the latter, we introduce a new two-step reduction process. The first step\n(internal-event reduction) produces the smallest observationally equivalent\nsigma-algebra and the second (internal-state reduction) removes sigma-algebra\ncomponents that are redundant for optimal prediction. For several classes of\nstochastic dynamical systems these reductions produce representations that are\nequivalent to epsilon-machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2004 22:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
