The distributions of\naverage surface brightness and morphology are widespread from relatively\ncompact high surface brightness objects to very diffuse low surface brightness\nones. The physical origins of these LABs may be (i) photo-ionization by massive\nstars, or active galactic nuclei, or (ii) cooling radiation from\ngravitationally heated gas, or (iii) shock heating by starburst driven galactic\nsuperwind. One third of them are apparently not associated with ultra-violet\ncontinuum sources that are bright enough to produce Ly-alpha emission, assuming\na Salpeter initial mass function. The 90% of these LABs are located inside the\nhigh surface density region of the 283 relatively compact and strong Ly-alpha\nemitters selected in our previous study. This suggests that these LABs may be\nthe phenomena related to dense environment at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2004 10:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using simple\nanalytic estimates on the one hand, and detailed 1+1-D models on the other\nhand, we show that, while the time scale for settling down to the equator may\nexceed the life time of the disk, it takes much less time for even small grains\nof 0.1 micron to settle down to a few pressure scale heights. This is often\nwell below the original location of the disk's photosphere, and the disk\ntherefore becomes effectively 'flatter'. If turbulent stirring is included, a\nsteady state solution can be found, which is typically reached after a few\ntimes 1E5 years. Dependent on the strength of the turbulence, the shape of the\ndisk in such a steady state can be either fully flaring, or flaring only up to\na certain radius and self-shadowed beyond that radius. We show that these\npartly self-shadowed disks have a much weaker mid- to far-infrared flux than\nthe fully flaring ones. We also show that these self-shadowed regions of the\ndisk are very weak in resolved images of scattered light, in contrast to the\nfully flaring disks. From the calculations with compact grains it follows that,\nafter about 1E6 years, most disks should be self-shadowed. The fact that some\nolder disks are still observed with the characteristics of flaring disks\ntherefore seems somewhat inconsistent with the time scales predicted by the\nsettling model based on compact grains. This suggests that perhaps even the\nsmall grains (lesssim 0.1 micron) have a porous or fractal structure, or that\nthe different geometries of observed disks is merely a reflection of the\nturbulent state of these disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2004 12:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the limit in which the exciton density is\nhigh, we assess the impact of weak `pair-breaking' disorder on the feasibility\nof condensation of cavity polaritons. The mean-field phase diagram shows a\n`lower density' region, where the condensate is dominated by electronic\nexcitations and where disorder tends to close the condensate and quench\ncoherence. Increasing the density of excitations in the system, partially due\nto the screening of Coulomb interaction, the excitations contributing to the\ncondensate become mainly photon-like and coherence is reestablished for any\nvalue of disorder. In contrast, in the photon dominated region of the phase\ndiagram, the energy gap of the quasi-particle spectrum still closes when the\ndisorder strength is increased. Above mean-field, thermal, quantum and\nfluctuations induced by disorder are considered and the spectrum of the\ncollective excitations is evaluated. In particular, it is shown that the angle\nresolved photon intensity exhibits an abrupt change in its behaviour, going\nfrom the condensed to the non-condensed region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 May 2004 15:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 10:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The technique is advocated as\nespecially effective for a certain class of quantum problems in continuum\nspace, for which only a few moments are necessary. For such problems, it is\nargued that the derivatives at origin can be evaluated by Monte Carlo\nsimulations via estimators of finite variances in the limit of an infinite\nnumber of path variables. Finally, a maximum entropy inversion algorithm for\nthe Hamburger moment problem is utilized to compute the quantum rate of\nreaction for a one-dimensional symmetric Eckart barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 2004 17:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2004 23:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 00:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This picture is complemented by the consideration of\nelectrons and photons as real particles in three-dimensional space, following\nguiding conditions derived from the particle-wave-functions to which they are\nassociated. The guiding condition for the electron is taken from Bohmian\nmechanics, while the photon velocity is defined as the ratio between the\nPoynting vector and the electromagnetic energy density. The case of many\nparticles is considered, taking into account their statistical properties. The\nformalism is applied to a two level system, providing a satisfactory\ndescription for spontaneous emission, Lamb shift, scattering, absorption,\ndispersion, resonance fluorescence and vacuum fields. This model adequately\ndescribes quantum jumps by the entanglement between the photon and the atomic\nsystem and it will prove to be very useful in the simulation of quantum devices\nfor quantum computers and quantum information systems.
