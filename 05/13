The large CIV/Ly-alpha\nratio in the broad-line region (BLR) emission from this object can be matched\nmost closely by a BLR dominated by gas at very high densities (10^15 cm^-3),\nwhich suppresses the Ly-alpha emission, and illuminated by an incident\npower-law extending to ~200 micron, which yields increased emission from purely\ncollisionally excited coolant lines (such as CIV, NV and OVI) but not from\nrecombination lines like Ly-alpha. However, the strong CIII emission predicted\nby this model is not observed, and the observed broad CIII] emission must come\nfrom a lower-density BLR component and should be accompanied by broad Ly-alpha\nemission which is not observed. The least unlikely explanation for this\nspectrum seems to be that any intrinsic broad Ly-alpha emission is removed by\nsmooth NV absorption in the red wing of the Ly-alpha emission line and by\nsmooth Ly-alpha absorption in the blue wing of the Ly-alpha emission line.
