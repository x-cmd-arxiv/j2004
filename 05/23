The method stands\nin creating a speed asymmetry between that of the source and that of the\nobserver, and relies on the centrifugation of a light source at ultrahigh\nspeed. When source and observer have the same speed, such as when being both on\nthe same inertial system, the deflection and the aberration compensate and\ntheir net effect is null. So, in order to circumscribe the odds of inertial\nsystems and to isolate these speed-induced effects it has instead been appealed\nto a centrifugal system, since it allows infringing symmetry between the source\nand the observer speeds. Three cases are considered. (a) Centrifugation of the\nsource fixed at one end of the rotor arm, while the detector is fixed on the\nrotor axis. This configuration of the experiment aims to unveil that due to the\nperipheral speed of the source the beam is deflected forward, so it impinges on\nthe centric detector slightly shifted from its position when the system was not\nrotating. (b) The positions of the source and the detector are interchanged, so\nthe source peripheral speed is then null and thus no speed-induced deflection\nensues, but due to the observer peripheral speed there is a speed-induced\naberration since during the beam time-of-flight the detector has slightly moved\nside-way. However, this time the spot shifts in opposite direction and hence\nthe effect of centrifugation is not reciprocal. (c) The source and the detector\nare fixed at the two ends of the rotor arms. In this case the beam deflection\nand aberration add, since their speed vectors have opposite directions and each\nshift of the spot on the detector is double since the time-of-flight is double.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 May 2004 21:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is distinctive in two main features: a\nlengthy collimated beam and an adjustable position of the photo-detector along\nthe telescope axis, so the beam length-of-flight can be varied from zero to the\ntelescope total length. This is achieved by means of a telecentric objective\nprojecting the collimated beam up to a movable CCD camera. The spot position on\na high-resolution photo-detector array is recorded, and the data are\ntransferred to a computer and treated by a beam analyser software. The\ntelescope aims to measure with high accuracy the aberration of stellar light\ndue to the earth orbital motion. An alternative would consist of fixing the\ntelecentric objective at the top of a cliff by means of an anti-vibration clamp\nwith a high-precision directional mount. The detector would be fixed on a\nmicrometric positioner, placed on the foot of the cliff at the beam position of\nfall. This way, the beam time-of-flight can be considerably increased, and\nhence the subsequent spot shift. For a beam length of 300 m the resulting shift\nwould be of 30 mm, and so in a year the spot would describe a circle of 60 mm\ndiameter.
