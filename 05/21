We focus on models with a thermal relic\ndensity, estimated with high accuracy using the DarkSUSY package, in the range\nfavored by current precision cosmological measurements. Direct and indirect\ndetection rates are computed implementing two models for the dark matter halo,\ntracing opposite regimes for the phase of baryon infall, with fully consistent\ndensity profiles and velocity distribution functions. This has allowed, for the\nfirst time, a fully consistent comparison between direct and indirect detection\nprospects. We discuss all relevant regimes in the mSUGRA parameter space,\nunderlining relevant effects, and providing the basis for extending the\ndiscussion to alternative frameworks. In general, we find that direct detection\nand searches for antideuterons in the cosmic rays seems to be the most\npromising ways to search for neutralinos in these scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 2004 07:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In particular, in the case of elemental wire consisting of the\ncenters with one electronic state per center, the number of states in the band\ncan be less than number of centers of the wire. These states form two bands\ninstead of single band and the bands exhibit non-analytical, square root\ndispersion in the vicinity of the point where both bands come together. These\nfindings are important for developing physically viable theory of electron\ntunneling in single molecular systems because the structure of spectrum of\nelectron's bound states and its relative position in respect to the Fermi\nlevels of electrodes determine specific mechanisms of electron transport\nthrough a molecular wire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2004 21:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2005 20:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The residue of the double pole was found to exhibit a significant\nquark mass dependence, evidenced by a negative slope of the effective mass\ninsertion (m_0^{eff})^2 as a function of m_{\\pi}^2. It has been observed by\nSharpe that, with a consistent NLO calculation in quenched chiral perturbation\ntheory, this mass dependence is uniquely predicted in terms of the single-pole\ncoefficient \\alpha_{\\Phi} and the Leutwyler parameter L_5. Since \\alpha_{\\Phi}\nis found to be approximately zero, the chiral slope of the double-pole residue\ndetermines a value for L_5. This provides a consistency check between the\nchiral slope of the hairpin mass insertion and that of the pion decay constant.\nWe investigate the consistency of these mass dependences in our Monte Carlo\nresults at two values of lattice spacing.

We focus on the appearance of a sharp peak due to a\nneutronization burst in the time profile; this phenomenon would occur if the\noriginal \\nu_e, produced at the neutrinosphere and becoming \\nu_{2,3} at the\nstellar surface, decays into a lighter antineutrino state such as \\bar\\nu_{1,2}\ncoupled to \\bar\\nu_e.

This conjecture\nis equivalent to the Topological Tverberg Theorem. Furthermore, many statements\nabout the Topological Tverberg Theorem transfer to the Winding Number\nConjecture, for example all currently proven cases of the Topological Tverberg\nTheorem as well as Sierksma's conjecture about the number of Tverberg\npartitions.\n  In the case $d=2$, the Winding Number Conjecture is a statement about\ncomplete graphs: It claims that in every image of $K_{3(q-1)+1}$ in the plane\neither $q-1$ triangles wind around one vertex or $q-2$ triangles wind around\nthe intersection of two edges, where the triangles, edges and vertices are\ndisjoint. We examine which other graphs have this property and find the minimal\nsubgraph of $K_7$ having this property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 May 2004 16:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
