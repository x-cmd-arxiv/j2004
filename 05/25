The standard synchrotron energy spectrum of cooling electrons F_E ~\nE^{-1/2} is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral\nslopes. An alternative in the form of quasi-thermal Comptonization in a high\ncompactness source has difficulties in reproducing the peak of the observed\nphoton distribution below a few hundred keV. We show here that for typical\nparameters expected in the GRB ejecta the observed spectra in the 20-1000 keV\nBATSE energy range can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of the\nsynchrotron radiation in a partially self-absorbed regime. If the particles are\ncontinuously accelerated/heated over the life-time of a source rather than\nbeing instantly injected, a prominent peak develops in their distribution at a\nLorentz factor gamma ~ 30-100, where synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses are\nbalanced by acceleration and heating due to synchrotron self-absorption. The\nsynchrotron peak should be observed at 10-100 eV, while the self-absorbed\nlow-energy tail with F_E ~ E^2 can produce the prompt optical emission (like in\nthe case of GRB 990123). The first Compton scattering radiation by nearly\nmonoenergetic electrons can then be as hard as F_E ~ E^1 reproducing the\nhardness of most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be\nobserved in the high energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the\nemission detected by EGRET in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair\nproduction reduces the available energy per particle, moving the spectral peaks\nto lower energies as the burst progresses. The regime is very robust, operates\nin a broad range of parameter space and can explain most of the observed GRB\nspectra and their temporal evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 15:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2004 14:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We conclude\nthat a universality class dependent form for the fluctuations is a\nparticularity of critical phenomena related to the change in symmetry at a\nphase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 09:10:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 15:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 16:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nlittle Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop\norder from the quadratic divergence. This allows the cutoff to be raised up to\n\\~10 TeV, beyond the scales probed by the precision data. However, strong\nconstraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale\nparticles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we\nshow that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge\nbosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions\nto the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories\ncompletely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of\nlittle Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low\nenergy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino. In particular,\nwe discuss in detail how to implement the T-parity in the littlest Higgs model\nbased on SU(5)/SO(5). The symmetry breaking scale f can be even lower than 500\nGeV if the contributions from the unknown UV physics at the cutoff are somewhat\nsmall. The existence of $T$-parity has drastic impacts on the phenomenology of\nthe little Higgs theories. The T-odd particles need to be pair-produced and\nwill cascade down to the lightest T-odd particle (LTP) which is stable. A\nneutral LTP gives rise to missing energy signals at the colliders which can\nmimic supersymmetry. It can also serve as a good dark matter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2004 21:44:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2004 14:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2004 15:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The incident momenta varied from 5.9 to 14.4 GeV/c,\ncorresponding to 4.8 < Q^2 < 12.7 (GeV/c)^2. First, we describe the\nmeasurements with the newer experiment, E850, which had more complete kinematic\ndefinition of quasielastic events. In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear\ntransparency effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 12:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

The\nwavefunction is computed via the standard map between the Lagrangian\ncoordinates and the Eulerian fields, which provides the analogue in this model\nof Huygens principle in wave mechanics. The method is illustrated by\ncalculating the time-dependence of a free Gaussian wavefunction. The Eulerian\nand Lagrangian pictures are complementary descriptions of a quantum process in\nthat they have associated Hamiltonian formulations that are connected by a\ncanonical transformation. The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which employs the\nsame set of trajectories, should not be conflated with the Lagrangian version\nof the hydrodynamic interpretation. The theory implies that the mathematical\nresults of the de Broglie-Bohm model may be regarded as statements about\nquantum mechanics itself rather than about its interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 11:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Localisable information is defined as\nthe amount of information that can be concentrated by means of classical\ncommunication and local operations where only maximally mixed states can be\nadded for free. The information deficit is defined as difference between total\ninformation contents of the state and localisable information. We consider a\nlarger class of operations: the so called PPT operations, which in addition\npreserve maximally mixed state (PPT-PMM operations). We formulate the related\noptimization problem as sedmidefnite program with suitable constraints. We then\nprovide bound for fidelity of transition of a given state into product pure\nstate on Hilbert space of dimension d. This allows to obtain general upper\nbound for localisable information (and also for information deficit). We\ncalculated the bounds exactly for Werner states and isotropic states in any\ndimension. Surprisingly it turns out that related bounds for information\ndeficit are equal to relative entropy of entanglement (in the case of Werner\nstates - regularized one). We compare the upper bounds with lower bounds based\non simple protocol of localisation of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 13:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We focus on the spin 1/2 case, considering a few simple yet solvable and\nphysically interesting cases, in order to understand how to interpret the\noperator. Our general representation is uniquely determined by the Green's\nfunction for the corresponding Schrodinger equation. We find that, in general,\nthe operator has a representation as a nonlocal composite of (at least) three\nsingularities. In the standard interpretation, the particle component has two\nnegative parts and one (hard core) positive part, while the antiparticle\ncomponent has two positive parts and one (hard core) negative part. This effect\nis confined within a Compton wavelength such that, at the point of singularity,\nthey cancel each other providing a finite result. Furthermore, the operator\nlooks like the identity outside a few Compton wavelengths (cutoff). To our\nknowledge, this is the first example of a physically relevant operator with\nthese properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 2004 13:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The diagonalization is analytic in that it is achieved without\ntransforming the wave functions, as is done by the Foldy-Wouthuysen method, and\nreveals the nonlocal time behavior of the particle-antiparticle relationship.\nWe interpret the zitterbewegung and the result that a velocity measurement (of\na Dirac particle) at any instant in time is, as reflections of the fact that\nthe Dirac equation makes a spatially extended particle appear as a point in the\npresent by forcing it to oscillate between the past and future at speed c. From\nthis we infer that, although the form of the Dirac equation serves to make\nspace and time appear on an equal footing mathematically, it is clear that they\nare still not on an equal footing from a physical point of view. On the other\nhand, the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, which connects the Dirac and square\nroot operator, is unitary.
