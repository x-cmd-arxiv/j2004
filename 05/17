From spectral synthesis in LTE we derive a lithium\nabundance of log e(Li)=3.5+/-0.4 and a C/O ratio between 3 and 5. This is the\nfirst detection of a lithium rich C-star in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Basing\non stellar models of appropriate chemical composition, we show that a similar C\nenrichment is compatible with that expectedfor a low mass low metallicity\nthermally pulsing AGB star, undergoing few third dredge up episodes. The\nposition in the log g-log Teff diagram of D461 is also compatible with this\ntheoretical scenario. In particular, the low effective temperature, lower than\nthat expected for a low metallicity giant star, is a consequence of the huge\nincrease of the envelope opacity occurring after the carbon dredge up. The Li\nenrichment may be explained if a deep circulation would take place during the\ninterpulse period, the so called cool bottom process. In spite of the low\nresolution of our spectra, we derive a lower limit for the carbon isotopic\nratio, namely 12C/13C>40, and a constraint for the Ba abundance, namely\n0.5<[Ba/Fe]< 2. The proposed scenario also fits these further constraints.\nThen, we estimate that the mass of D461 ranges between 1.2 and 2 $M_\\odot$,\nwhich corresponds to an age ranging between 1 and 3 Gyr.

In this\nchapter, after illustrating the spike-sorting problem with real data, we\npropose a more realistic spike train generation model. It incorporates both a\ndescription of \"non trivial\" (ie, non Poisson) neuronal discharge statistics\nand a description of spike waveform dynamics (eg, the events amplitude decays\nfor short inter-spike intervals). We show that this spike train generation\nmodel is analogous to a one-dimensional Potts spin glass model. We can\ntherefore use the computational methods which have been developed in fields\nwhere Potts models are extensively used. These methods are based on the\nconstruction of a Markov Chain in the space of model parameters and spike train\nconfigurations, where a configuration is defined by specifying a neuron of\norigin for each spike. This Markov Chain is built such that its unique\nstationary density is the posterior density of model parameters and\nconfigurations given the observed data. A Monte Carlo simulation of the Markov\nChain is then used to estimate the posterior density. The theoretical\nbackground on Markov chains is provided and the way to build the transition\nmatrix of the Markov Chain is illustrated with a simple, but realistic, model\nfor data generation . Simulated data are used to illustrate the performance of\nthe method and to show that it can easily cope with neurons generating spikes\nwith highly dynamic waveforms and/or generating strongly overlapping clusters\non Wilson plots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 May 2004 13:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
