A close look into the\nsupersymmetric trace identity, which naturally accommodates the central-charge\nanomaly and its superpartners, shows an interesting consequence of the\nimprovement of the supercurrent: Via an improvement the anomaly in the central\ncharge can be transferred from induced spin in the fermion sector to an induced\npotential in the boson sector.

Contributions from the direct (one-step) and sequential\n(two-step) $2n$-transfers were treated explicitly based on a realistic\nassumption for the $2n$-transfer form factor. The oscillatory pattern observed\nin $^4$He($^6$He,$^6$He)$^4$He angular distribution at low energies was found\nto be due to an interference between the elastic scattering and $2n$-transfer\namplitudes. Our CRC analysis shows consistently that the direct $2n$-transfer\nstrongly dominates over the sequential transfer and thus confirms the dominance\nof 2$n-^4$He configuration over the $n-^5$He one in the $^6$He wave function.\nThis result suggests a strong clusterization of the two valence neutrons and\nallows, therefore, a reliable estimate for the \\emph{di-neutron} spectroscopic\namplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2004 02:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A parity violating shift of the NMR\nfrequency arises due to the combined effect of the lattice crystal field and\nthe anapole moment of the rare-earth nucleus.\n  We show that there are two different observable effects related to frequency:\n1) A shift of the NMR frequency in an external electric field applied to the\nsolid. The value of the shift is about \\Delta \\nu_1 ~ 10^{-5} Hz with E = 10\nkV/cm; 2) A splitting of the NMR line into two lines. The second effect is\nindependent of the external electric field. The value of the splitting is about\n\\Delta \\nu_2 ~ 0.5 Hz and it depends on the orientation of the crystal with\nrespect to magnetic field.
