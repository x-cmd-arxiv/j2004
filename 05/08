Alternatively, lensing can produce\nmultiply-imaged systems in which the extra images are either unresolved or too\nfaint to be detectable. This phenomenon is dominated by galaxies and lower-mass\nhalos (<~1e12 Msun), and is very sensitive to the inner density profile of the\nhalos.

However, numerical simulations by Kim & Morris showed that this is only\npossible if the cluster initially has an extremely dense core. Hansen &\nMilosavljevic recently suggested that the presence of an IMBH in the cluster\ncore might stabilize the core against tidal disruption during the inspiral\nthrough dynamical friction, and thus might easily deliver young stars down to\nthe central parsec. We find that the presence of an IMBH does lower the minimum\ninitial core density required to transport young stars down to the central\nparsec, but this is possible only when the mass of the IMBH is at least ~10% of\nthe total cluster mass. This fraction is significantly higher than that\nestimated by Portegies Zwart & McMillan with numerical simulations of IMBH\nformation by successive merging of stars in the cluster core, so it does not\nappear that a realistic IMBH can help transport young stars into the central\nparsec.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2004 05:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In these terms the breakdown occurs\nthrough the formation of a certain critical nucleus in the metastable vehicle\nflow, which is located near the on-ramp. The strong cooperative car interaction\nin the synchronized traffic enables us to treat the size of critical jam nuclei\nas a large value and to apply to an effective one-lane model. This model\nassumes the following. First, the growth of a car cluster is governed by the\nattachment of cars to the cluster whose rate is mainly specified by the total\ntraffic flow. Second, the cluster dissolution is determined by the car escape\nfrom the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly. Third, the\ngeneration of one-car clusters (preclusters) is caused by cars entering the\nmain road from the on-ramp. The appropriate master equation for the car cluster\nevolution is written and the generation rate of critical jam nuclei is found.\nThe obtained results are in agreement with the empirical facts that the\ncharacteristic time scale of the breakdown phenomenon is about or greater than\none minute and the traffic flow rate interval inside which traffic breakdowns\nare observed is sufficiently wide. Besides, as a new results, it is shown that\nthe traffic breakdown probability can be analyzed, at least approximately,\nbased solely on the data of the total vehicle flow without separating it into\nthe vehicle streams on the main road and on-ramp when the relative on-ramp flow\nvolume exceeds 10%--20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2004 09:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this case, there is a simple and exact\nrelation between the effective omega-meson mass and the effective omega-nucleon\ncoupling. Because of this relation, the effective omega-nucleon coupling\nautomatically decreases if the effective omega-meson mass decreases.\nConsequently, the equation of state becomes softer. A trial to embed the QCD\nsum-rule results into the hadron field theory is also shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 May 2004 15:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 11:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This photobleaching occurs within the duration of the\nlaser pulse (3 ns FWHM); it is caused by photoinduced electron detrapping\nfollowed by rapid recombination of the resulting free electron and a trapped\nhole. The quantum yield for the electron photobleaching is ca. 0.28 for 532 nm\nand ca. 0.024 for 1064 nm photoexcitation. Complete separation of the spectral\ncontributions from trapped electron and hole is demonstrated using glycerol as\na selective hole scavenger. When glycerol is added to the solution, some\nlight-absorbing holes are scavenged promptly within the duration of the 355 nm\nphotoexcitation pulse, some are scavenged at a slower rate over the first 200\nns after the 355 nm pulse, and the rest are not scavenged, even at high\nconcentration of the scavenger (> 10 vol %). A reaction with chemi- and physi-\nsorbed glycerol would account for the prompt and the slow hole decay,\nrespectively. The implications of these results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 May 2004 19:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
