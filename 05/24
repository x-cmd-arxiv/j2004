Like\nthe well-known construction of the real numbers using Dedekind cuts, the idea\nis inspired by the ancient Greek theory of proportion, due to Eudoxus. However,\nunlike the Dedekind construction, the construction proceeds directly from the\nintegers to the real numbers bypassing the intermediate construction of the\nrational numbers.\n  The construction of the additive group of the reals depends on rather simple\nalgebraic properties of the integers. This part of the construction can be\ngeneralised in several natural ways, e.g., with an arbitrary abelian group\nplaying the role of the integers. This raises the question: what does the\nconstruction construct? In an appendix we sketch some generalisations and\nanswer this question in some simple cases.\n  The treatment of the main construction is intended to be self-contained and\nassumes familiarity only with elementary algebra in the ring of integers and\nwith the definitions of the abstract algebraic notions of group, ring and\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 May 2004 15:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
