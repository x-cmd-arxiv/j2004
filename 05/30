In this paper,\nwe use the Spitzer Space Telescope First Look Survey (FLS) to assess what\nfraction of AGN with mid-infrared luminosities comparable to quasars are missed\nin optical quasar surveys due to dust obscuration. We begin by using the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) database to identify 54 quasars within the 4 deg^2\nextragalactic FLS. These quasars occupy a distinct region in mid-infrared color\nspace by virtue of their strong, red, continua. This has allowed us to define a\nmid-infrared color criterion for selecting AGN candidates. About 2000 FLS\nobjects have colors consistent with them being AGN, but most are much fainter\nin the mid-infrared than the SDSS quasars, which typically have 8 micron flux\ndensities, S(8.0), ~1 mJy. We have investigated the properties of the 43\nobjects with S(8.0) >= 1 mJy satisfying our AGN color selection. This sample\nshould contain both unobscured quasars, and AGN which are absent from the SDSS\nsurvey due to extinction in the optical. After removing 16 known quasars, three\nprobable normal quasars, and eight spurious or confused objects from the\ninitial sample of 43, we are left with 16 objects which are likely to be\nobscured quasars or luminous Seyfert-2 galaxies.
