This work applies to an electron in\nthe s -type orbital ground state of a quantum dot or bound to a donor impurity,\nand is valid for arbitrary polarization p of the nuclear spin system, and\narbitrary nuclear spin I in high magnetic fields. In the limit of p=1 and\nI=1/2, the Born approximation of our perturbative theory recovers the exact\nelectron spin dynamics. We have found the form of the generalized master\nequation (GME) for the longitudinal and transverse components of the electron\nspin to all orders in the electron spin--nuclear spin flip-flop terms. Our\nperturbative expansion is regular, unlike standard time-dependent perturbation\ntheory, and can be carried-out to higher orders. We show this explicitly with a\nfourth-order calculation of the longitudinal spin dynamics. In zero magnetic\nfield, the fraction of the electron spin that decays is bounded by the\nsmallness parameter \\delta=1/p^{2}N, where N is the number of nuclear spins\nwithin the extent of the electron wave function.

In general the electron spin shows rich dynamics, described\nby a sum of contributions with non-exponential decay, exponential decay, and\nundamped oscillations. There is an abrupt crossover in the electron spin\nasymptotics at a critical dimensionality and shape of the electron envelope\nwave function.

Two distinct mechanisms contribute to slowing down shorter\nchains. One has been described earlier by Han et al.: the chains are delayed at\nthe entrance of the constriction and escape with a rate that increases with\nchain length. The other, actually dominating mechanism is here reported for the\nfirst time: Some chains diffuse out of their main path into the corners of the\nbox, where they remain trapped for a long time. The probability that this\nhappens increases with the diffusion constant, i.e., the inverse chain length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2004 20:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Physical\napproach, which takes advantage of their extensively quantified mortality,\nestablishes that its dominant fraction yields the exact law, and suggests its\nunusual mechanism. The law is universal for all animals, from yeast to humans,\ndespite their drastically different biology and evolution. It predicts that the\nuniversal mortality has short memory of the life history, at any age may be\nreset to its value at a significantly younger age, and mean life expectancy\nextended (by biologically unprecedented small changes) from its current maximal\nvalue to immortality. Mortality change is rapid and stepwise. Demographic data\nand recent experiments verify these predictions for humans, rats, flies,\nnematodes and yeast. In particular, mean life expectancy increased 6-fold (to\n\"human\" 430 years), with no apparent loss in health and vitality, in nematodes\nwith a small number of perturbed genes and tissues. Universality allows one to\nstudy unusual mortality mechanism and the ways to immortality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 2004 08:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2004 20:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
