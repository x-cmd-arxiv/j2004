Core rotation\nmeasures for quasars vary from approximately 500 to several thousand radians\nper meter squared. Quasar jets have rotation measures which are typically 500\nradians per meter squared or less. The cores and jets of the BL Lac objects\nhave rotation measures similar to those found in quasar jets. The jets of radio\ngalaxies exhibit a range of rotation measures from a few hundred radians per\nmeter squared to almost 10,000 radians per meter squared for the jet of M87.\nRadio galaxy cores are generally depolarized, and only one of four radio\ngalaxies (3C-120) has a detectable rotation measure in the core. Several\npotential identities for the foreground Faraday screen are considered and we\nbelieve the most promising candidate for all the AGN types considered is a\nscreen in close proximity to the jet. This constrains the path length to\napproximately 10 parsecs, and magnetic field strengths of approximately 1\nmicroGauss can account for the observed rotation measures. For 27 out of 34\nquasars and BL Lacs their optically thick cores have good agreement to a lambda\nsquared law. This requires the different tau = 1 surfaces to have the same\nintrinsic polarization angle independent of frequency and distance from the\nblack hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2004 01:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We solve numerically the exact phase equilibrium\nequations that result from accurate free energy expressions for the fluid and\nsolid phases, while accounting fully for size fractionation between coexisting\nphases. Fluids up to the largest polydispersities that we can study (around\n14%) can phase separate by splitting off a solid with a much narrower size\ndistribution. This shows that experimentally observed terminal polydispersities\nabove which phase separation no longer occurs must be due to non-equilibrium\neffects. We find no evidence of re-entrant melting; instead, sufficiently\ncompressed solids phase separate into two or more solid phases. Under\nappropriate conditions, coexistence of multiple solids with a fluid phase is\nalso predicted.

We also propose a method for constructing quantities that\noptimally distinguish between the coexisting phases, using Principal Component\nAnalysis in the space of density distributions.

As an example, we consider conventional supergravity with a stable\ngravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle. The next-lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (NLSP) decays to the gravitino through gravitational\ninteractions after about a year. This lifetime can be measured by stopping\nNLSPs at colliders and observing their decays. Such studies will yield a\nmeasurement of Newton's gravitational constant on unprecedentedly small scales,\nshed light on dark matter, and provide a window on the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 May 2004 20:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We focus on the gravitational aspects of the\nduality. Specifically, we identify the gravitational holographic data and\nprovide the way Minkowski space-time (understood in more general context as a\nRicci-flat space) is reconstructed from the data. In order to avoid the\ncomplexity of non-linear Einstein equations we consider linear perturbations\nand do the analysis for the perturbations. The analysis proceeds in two steps.\nWe first reduce the problem in Minkowski space to an infinite set of field\nequations on de Sitter space one dimension lower. These equations are quite\nremarkable: they describe massless and massive gravitons in de Sitter space. In\nparticular, the partially massless graviton appears naturally in this\nreduction. In the second step we solve the graviton field equations and\nidentify the holographic boundary data.
