The similarity of the jets of this source and jets in\nradio galaxies or radio-loud quasars suggests that we should detect\nlarge-scale, synchrotron emitting radio structures surrounding GRS 1915+105.\nHowever, these large structures have not been found. We show that by adapting a\nmodel for the radio lobes of extragalatic jet sources we predict a radio\nsurface brightness of the equivalent structures of GRS 1915+105 below the\ncurrent detection limits. The model uses an energy transport rate of the jets\naveraged over the jet lifetime. This transport rate is found to be considerably\nlower than the power of the jets during the rare major ejection events. Thus\nthe lobes contain less energy than would be inferred from these events and\nproduce a lower radio luminosity.

Dynamic correlation effects for classical particles,\ninitially distributed by random way, are considered within the scope of\ndeterministic and stochastic descriptions. A temporal analysis of elastic\nreflections from the SB square walls and circle obstacles is given for distinct\ngeometries in terms of the wall-collision and the circle-collision\ndistributions. Late-time steady dynamic regimes are explicit in the diffusion\nexponent $z(R)$, which plays a role of the order-disorder crossover dynamical\nparameter. The ballistic ($z_{0}=1$) ordered motion in the square lattice (R=0)\nswitches to the superdiffusion regime with $z_{1}=1.5$, which is\ngeometry-independent when $R<L\\sqrt{2}/4$. This observed universal dynamics is\nshown to arise from long-distance particle jumps along the diagonal and\nnondiagonal Bleher corridors in the LG with the infinite horizon geometry. In\nthe corresponding SB, this universal regime is caused by the long-time\nwall-collision memory effects attributed to the bouncing-ball orbits. The\ncrossover nonuniversal behavior with $1.5<z<2$ is due to geometry with\n$L\\sqrt{2}/4\\leq R<L/2$, when only the nondiagonal corridors remain open. All\nthe free-motion corridors are closed in LG with finite horizon ($R\\geq L/2$)\nand the interplay between square and circle geometries results in the chaotic\ndynamics ensured by the normal Brownian diffusion ($z_{2}=2$) and by the normal\nGaussian distribution of collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 May 2004 22:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We start with an overview of current experimental\nand theoretical issues in Relativistic heavy ion physics. We then introduce\nstatistical hadronization, and show how it gives a description of particle\nabundances and spectra through covariance and entropy maximization. We argue\nthat a distinction can be made between equilibrated staged freeze-out in which\npost-formation hadron interactions play an important role in determining\nfinal-state observables, and non-equilibrium sudden freeze-out where spectra\nand abundances get determined at the same time and further interactions are\nnegligible. We attempt to falsify sudden freeze-out by examining whether\nparticle abundances and spectra can be described using the same formation\ntemperature. This is done both in the equilibrium framework, and using a\nchemical non-equilibrium ansatz. Our fits to experimental data suggest that the\nsudden freeze-out model explains both the particle abundances and spectra. We\nthen try to extract the particle formation temperature, and quantify\npost-freeze-out hadronic interactions using experimentally observable\nresonances. We discuss observed resonances and suggest further measurements\nthat have the potential to distinguish between the possible freeze-out\nscenarios experimentally. Finally, we infer from experimental data how particle\nformation proceeds in spacetime, in particular whether freeze-out dynamics\nagrees with the sudden freeze-out expectation.

These spectra were obtained in\nthe intervals of 50 nm between 500 and 1700 nm. Two distinctive regimes of the\nspectral evolution were observed. In both of these regimes, the spectral\nprofile changes considerably with delay time. For t<1ps, two new features (the\n1150 nm band and 1400 nm shoulder) were observed in the spectral region where\nO-H overtones appear in the spectra of light water. These two features were not\nobserved for the e- in D2O. Vibronic coupling to the modes of water molecules\nlining the solvation cavity is a possible origin of these features. On the\nsub-picosecond time scale, the absorption band of e- progressively shifts to\nthe blue. At later delay times (t> 1ps), the position of the band maximum is\n\"locked\", but the spectral profile continues to change by narrowing on the red\nside and broadening on the blue side; the oscillator strength is constant\nwithin 10%. The time constant of this narrowing is ca. 0.56 ps for H2O and 0.64\nps for D2O, respectively. Vibrational relaxation and time-dependent decrease in\nthe size and anisotropy of the solvation cavity are suggested as possible\ncauses for the observed spectral transformations in both of these regimes. The\ngeminate recombination kinetics for hydrated electrons generated by absorption\nof two 200 nm quanta (12.4 eV total energy) in light and heavy water are almost\nidentical, suggesting that the average separation between the e- and its\ngeminate partners in D2O is 13% narrower than in H2O.
