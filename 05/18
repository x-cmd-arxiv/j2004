The most important result of this\nstudy is to stress the importance of shielding the molecular gas from the\ndestructive effects of UV radiation. For shock ram pressures comparable to or\nexceeding typical local ISM pressures, self-shielding controls the formation\ntime of H2 but CO formation requires shielding of the interstellar radiation\nfield by dust grains. We find that the molecular hydrogen fractional abundance\ncan become significant well before CO forms. The timescale for (CO) molecular\ncloud formation is not set by H2 formation, but rather by the timescale for\naccumulating a sufficient column density or extinction, A_V > 0.7. The local\nratio of atomic to molecular gas (4:1), coupled with short estimates for cloud\nlifetimes (3-5 Myr), suggests that the timescales for accumulating molecular\nclouds from atomic material typically must be no longer than about 12-20 Myr.\nBased on the shielding requirement, this implies that the typical product of\npre-shock density and velocity must be n*v > 20 cm^-3 km s^-1. Based on these\nresults we find that flow-driven formation of molecular clouds in the local\ninterstellar medium can occur sufficiently rapidly to account for observations.\nWe also provide detailed predictions of atomic and molecular emission and\nabsorption that track molecular cloud formation, with a view toward helping to\nverify cloud formation by shock waves.

The Brans Dicke theory is modified to\nenable the creation of matter and energy out of the self contained\ngravitational and scalar fields constrained by the local conservation of energy\nso that rest masses vary whereas the observed Newtonian Gravitation 'constant'\ndoes not. There is a conformal equivalence between self-creation and General\nRelativity in vacuo, which results in the predictions of the two theories being\nequal in the standard tests. In self-creation test particles in vacuo follow\nthe geodesics of General Relativity. Nevertheless there are three types of\nexperiment, including the LIGO apparatus & Gravity Probe B geodetic precession,\nwhich are able to distinguish between the two theories. Self-creation is as\nconsistent with cosmological constraints as the standard paradigm, without the\naddition of the undiscovered physics of Inflation, dark non-baryonic matter, or\ndark energy. It does demand an exotic equation of state, which requires a false\nvacuum energy determined by the field equations. The two conformal frames\nconserve energy or energy-momentum and choose photons or atoms as the standard\nof measurement respectively. In the former frame the universe is stationary and\neternal with exponentially shrinking rulers and accelerating atomic clocks, and\nin the latter frame the universe is freely coasting, expanding linearly from a\nBig Bang with rigid rulers and regular atomic clocks.

We\ndescribe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm,\nwhich implies that the adiabatic computation model and the conventional quantum\ncomputation model are polynomially equivalent. Our result can be extended to\nthe physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional\ngrid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models\nprovides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues in quantum\ncomputation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and constructing fault\ntolerant quantum computers. In particular, by translating the main open\nquestions in the area of quantum algorithms to the language of spectral gaps of\nsparse matrices, the result makes these questions accessible to a wider\nscientific audience, acquainted with mathematical physics, expander theory and\nrapidly mixing Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 08:30:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2005 16:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-11-22"}

We\npropose an implementation of quantum computation using coherent states of the\nvibrational modes of trapped ions. Differently from earlier experiments, we\nconsider a far-off resonance for the interaction between external fields and\nthe ion in a bidimensional trap. By appropriate choices of the detunings\nbetween the external fields, the adiabatic elimination of the ionic excited\nlevel from the Hamiltonian of the system allows for beam splitting between\northogonal vibrational modes, production of coherent states and non-linear\ninteractions of various kinds. In particular, this model enables the generation\nof the four coherent Bell states. Furthermore, all the necessary operations for\nquantum computation such as preparation of qubits, one-qubit and controlled\ntwo-qubit operations, are possible. The detection of the state of a vibrational\nmode in a Bell state is made possible by the combination of resonant and\noff-resonant interactions between the ion and some external fields. We show\nthat our read-out scheme provides highly efficient discrimination between all\nthe four Bell states. We extend this to a quantum register composed of many\nindividually trapped ions. In this case, operations on two remote qubits are\npossible through a cavity mode. We emphasize that our remote-qubit operation\nscheme does not require a high quality factor resonator: the cavity field acts\nas a catalyst for the gate operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 08:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

I analyze multipartite entanglement produced by the $\\eta$\npairing mechanism which features strongly in the fermionic lattice models of\nhigh $T_c$ superconductivity. This problem is shown to be equivalent to\ncalculating multipartite entanglement in totally symmetric states of qubits. I\ndemonstrate that we can conclusively calculate the relative entropy of\nentanglement within any subset of qubits in an overall symmetric state. Three\nmain results then follow. First, I show that the condition for\nsuperconductivity, namely the existence of the off diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO), is not dependent on two-site entanglement, but on just classical\ncorrelations as the sites become more and more distant. Secondly, the\nentanglement that does survive in the thermodynamical limit is the entanglement\nof the total lattice and, at half filling, it scales with the log of the number\nof sites. It is this entanglement that will exist at temperatures below the\nsuperconducting critical temperature, which can currently be as high as 160\nKelvin. Thirdly, I prove that a complete mixture of symmetric states does not\ncontain any entanglement in the macroscopic limit. On the other hand, the same\nmixture of symmetric states possesses the same two qubit entanglement features\nas the pure states involved, in the sense that the mixing does not destroy\nentanglement for finite number of qubits, albeit it does decrease it. Maximal\nmixing of symmetric states also does not destroy ODLRO and classical\ncorrelations. I discuss various other inequalities between different\nentanglements as well as generalizations to the subsystems of any\ndimensionality (i.e. higher than spin half).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 2004 15:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
