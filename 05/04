Consequently, the wave\nequation results in a three-term recursion relation for the expansion\ncoefficients of the wavefunction. The solution of this recursion relation is\nobtained in terms of the continuous dual Hahn orthogonal polynomials. On the\nother hand, for the discrete spectrum (i.e., for bound states with energies\nless than the rest mass) the spinor wave functions result in a diagonal matrix\nrepresentation for the Dirac-Morse Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 22:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The peculiarity of\nthe functional integrals in question is because of the fact that the\nintegration variables depend on the imaginary time ``automorphically''. In\nother words, the integration variables are multiplied with a certain complex\nnumber when the imaginary time is shifted by a period. Therefore, the\ncorresponding boundary conditions at the ends of the imaginary time segment are\nnot of the form corresponding to fermionic, or bosonic, variables taken in the\nMatsubara representation at nonzero temperature. In fact, one part of sites of\nthe models corresponds to the integration variables which are subjected to the\nunusual boundary conditions, while the variables on the other sites depend on\nthe imaginary time conventionally, i.e., as fermions (or bosons). Thus a\nsituation, when an ``automorphic'' boundary condition is the same for all sites\nof a chain spin model, is generalized. The results of the functional\nintegration are obtained in the form of determinants of the matrix operators\nwhich are regularized by means of the generalized zeta-function approach. The\npartition functions of the models and certain correlation functions at nonzero\ntemperature are obtained explicitly thus demonstrating correctness of the\nfunctional integral representations proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 11:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
