This\nprevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope\nof the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction\ndecreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s\naccuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the\nvirial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found\nin LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear\ninconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al.

Replacing the NFW DM model\nby the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given\nradius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within\nr_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight\n(strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well\nmodelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2\nr/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for\nthe isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly\nexplain the low PN VDs, but not in full.

With simulation samples produced by a hybrid\ncosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code, which is effective in capturing shocks\nand complicated structures with high precision, we find that the one-point\ndistributions of the IGM field are systematically different from that of dark\nmatter as follows: 1.) the one-point distribution of the IGM peculiar velocity\nfield is exponential at least at redshifts less than 2, while the dark matter\nvelocity field is close to a Gaussian field; 2.) although the one-point\ndistributions of the IGM and dark matter are similar, the point-by-point\ncorrelation between the IGM and dark matter density fields significantly\ndiffers on all scales and redshifts analyzed; 3.) the one-point density\ndistributions of the difference between IGM and dark matter fields are highly\nnon-Gaussian and long tailed. These discrepancies violate the similarity\nbetween the IGM and dark matter and cannot be explained simply as Jeans\nsmoothing of the IGM.

The system is found to be a fossil\ngalaxy group. The group X-ray emission is composed of a central dense cool core\n(10 kpc in radius) and an isothermal medium beyond the central 10 kpc. The\nregion between 10 and 50 kpc (the cooling radius) has the same temperature as\nthe gas from 50 kpc to 400 kpc although the gas cooling time between 10 and 50\nkpc (2 - 6 Gyr) is shorter than the Hubble time. Thus, the ESO 3060170 group\ndoes not have a group-sized cooling core. We suggest that the group cooling\ncore may have been heated by a central AGN outburst in the past and the small\ndense cool core is the truncated relic of a previous cooling core. The Chandra\nobservations also reveal a variety of X-ray features in the central region,\nincluding a ``finger'', an edge-like feature and a small ``tail'', all aligned\nalong a north-south axis, as are the galaxy light and group galaxy\ndistribution. The proposed AGN outburst may cause gas ``sloshing'' around the\ncenter and produce these asymmetric features. The observed flat temperature\nprofile to 1/3 R_vir is not consistent with the predicted temperature profile\nin recent numerical simulations. We compare the entropy profile of the ESO\n3060170 group with those of three other groups and find a flatter relation than\nthat predicted by simulations involving only shock heating, S $\\propto$ r$^{~\n0.85}$.

The method differs from known\ntechniques in several aspects, namely, it: 1) doesn't need any assumptions\nconcerning an internal structure of a molecule; 2) doesn't involve any\nintermediate parameters (as molecular constants in traditional techniques); 3)\ngives an opportunity to use in one-stage optimization procedure all available\nexperimental data obtained for various band systems, by various authors, and in\nvarious works; 4) provides in an interactive mode the opportunity to select the\nexperimental values, eliminating rough errors, to revise wrong identifications\nof spectral lines and to compare various sets of experimental data for mutual\nconsistency; 5) allows to obtain not only an optimal set of rovibronic term\nvalues, but also the error bars depending on quantity and quality of existing\nexperimental data.
