We first reduce the problem to a\nsingle-image deblurring for which the regularization parameter can be estimated\nthrough a classic generalized cross-validation (GCV) method. A modification of\nthis function is used for correcting the undersmoothing typical of the original\ntechnique. With a second method, we minimize an average least-squares fit to\nthe images and define a new GCV function. In the last approach, we use the\nclassical $GCV$ on a single higher-dimensional image obtained by concatanating\nall the images into a single vector. With a reliable estimator of the\nregularization parameter, one can fully exploit the excellent computational\ncharacteristics typical of direct deblurring methods, which, especially for\nlarge images, makes them competitive with the more flexible but much slower\niterative algorithms. The performance of the techniques is analyzed through\nnumerical experiments. We find that under the independent homoscedastic and\nGaussian assumptions made on the noise, the three approaches provide almost\nidentical results with the first single image providing the practical advantage\nthat no new software is required and the same image can be used with other\ndeblurring algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 2004 18:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We make\nassumptions of beta-model gas distributions and of hydrostatic equilibrium, to\nevaluate probability densities for the gas mass and total mass out to r_200.\nOur combined estimate of the gas fraction is 0.08^{+0.06}_{-0.04}h^{-1} The\nrandom errors are poor (note that the errors are higher than would have been\nobtained with the usual chi-squared method) but the control of bias is good. We\nhave described the MCMC analysis method specifically in terms of SZ but hope\nthe description will be of more general use. We find that the effects of\nprimordial CMB contamination tend to be similar in the estimates of both the\ngas mass and total mass over our narrow range of angular scales, so that there\nis little effect of primordials on the gas fraction determination. Using our\ntotal mass estimates we find a normalisation of the mass-temperature relation\nbased on the profiles from the VSA cluster pressure maps that is in good\nagreement with recent M-T determinations from X-ray cluster measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2004 15:09:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2004 15:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The chiral quark soliton model is a\nsimple quark model that incorporates the basic features of QCD. The B=2 axially\nsymmetric soliton solution within this model was obtained numerically. For $B\n\\ge 3$, in a series of our papers we obtained $B=3 \\sim 9,17$ minimal energy\nsoliton solutions with point-like symmetries and $B=3 \\sim 5$ axially symmetric\nsaddle-point solutions, using rational map ansatz constructed for multi-baryon\nnumber skyrmions. An interesting property of the solutions is that the symmetry\nof the background configuration is reflected in the degeneracy of the valence\nquark spectra. We also confirm the existence of the quark shell structure. The\nshells consist of the four-fold degenerate ground state and higher levels with\nvarious patterns, which are realized by the interplay of two symmetries,\n$SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry for the quarks and the symmetries of the\nchiral fields.

We exactly integrate out irrelevant quark modes and hard\ngluon modes in the functional integral representation of the QCD partition\nfunction.

The approach of a first principle quantum heat engine toward\nthis stable limit cycle is studied. The engine is based on a working medium\nconsisting of an ensemble of quantum systems composed of two coupled spins. A\nfour stroke cycle of operation is studied, with two {\\em isochore} branches\nwhere heat is transferred from the hot/cold baths and two {\\em adiabats} where\nwork is exchanged. The dynamics is generated by a completely positive map. It\nhas been shown that the performance of this model resembles an engine with\nintrinsic friction. The quantum conditional entropy is employed to prove the\nmonotonic approach to a limit cycle. Other convex measures, such as the quantum\ndistance display the same monotonic approach. The equations of motion of the\nengine are solved for the different branches and are combined to a global\npropagator that relates the state of the engine in the beginning of the cycle\nto the state after one period of operation of the cycle. The eigenvalues of the\npropagator define the rate of relaxation toward the limit cycle. A longitudinal\nand transverse mode of approach to the limit cycle is identified. The entropy\nbalance is used to explore the necessary conditions which lead to a stable\nlimit cycle. The phenomena of friction can be identified with a zero change in\nthe von Neumann entropy of the working medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2004 09:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Here, a quantum state is said to be macroscopically\nentangled if it is a superposition of macroscopically distinct states. To judge\nwhether such superposition is hidden in a general state, we use an essentially\nunique index p: A pure state is macroscopically entangled if p=2, whereas it\nmay be entangled but not macroscopically if p<2. This index is directly related\nto the stability of the state. We calculate the index p for various states in\nwhich magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers. We find\nmacroscopically entangled states (p=2) as well as states with p=1. The former\nstates are unstable in the sense that they are unstable against some local\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the latter states are stable in the senses\nthat they are stable against local measurements and that their decoherence\nrates never exceed O(N) in any weak classical noises. For comparison, we also\ncalculate the von Neumann entropy S(N) of a subsystem composed of N/2 spins as\na measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that S(N) of some states with p=1\nis of the same order of magnitude as the maximum value N/2. On the other hand,\nS(N) of the macroscopically entangled states with p=2 is as small as O(log N)<<\nN/2. Therefore, larger S(N) does not mean more instability. We also point out\nthat these results are analogous to those for interacting many bosons.\nFurthermore, the origin of the huge entanglement, as measured either by p or\nS(N), is discussed to be due to the spatial propagation of magnons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 May 2004 10:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2004 10:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The same local rules also generate the global\ntime step for automata with periodic boundary conditions. Our main structure\ntheorem asserts that any quantum cellular automaton is structurally reversible,\ni.e., that it can be obtained by applying two blockwise unitary operations in a\ngeneralized Margolus partitioning scheme. This implies that, in contrast to the\nclassical case, the inverse of a nearest neighbor quantum cellular automaton is\nagain a nearest neighbor automaton.\n  We present several construction methods for quantum cellular automata, based\non unitaries commuting with their translates, on the quantization of\n(arbitrary) reversible classical cellular automata, on quantum circuits, and on\nClifford transformations with respect to a description of the single cells by\nfinite Weyl systems.
