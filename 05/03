In this paper, we apply a power\nequalization (PE) filter to the high-latitude WMAP data in order to reconstruct\nthese low-l multipoles free from the largest Galactic foreground modelling\nuncertainties in the Galactic plane. The characteristic spatial distributions\nof the modes of order l=2,3,4,5 have been determined as a function of\nfrequency, sky coverage and two methods for foreground correction: using the\ntemplate fitting results of Bennett et al. (2003) and by a simple linear\nprojection scheme assuming the spectral dependence of the foreground\ncomponents. Our analyses suggest that the K and Ka frequency bands remain\nsignificantly contaminated by residual foreground emission for the WMAP Kp2\nmask. However, the l=3,4,5 multipole maps for the Q, V and W channels indicate\nthat, after foreground cleaning, these multipoles are dominated by the CMB\nanisotropy component. We confirm the Tegmark et al. (2003) result that the\noctopole does indeed show structure in which its hot and cold spots are centred\non a single plane in the sky, and show further that this is very stable with\nrespect to the applied mask and foreground correction. The estimated quadrupole\nis much less stable showing non-negligible dependence on the Galactic\nforeground correction. Including these uncertainties is likely to weaken the\nstatistical significance of the claimed alignment between the quadrupole and\noctopole. Nevertheless, these anisotropy patterns are also present for in\nCOBE-DMR data, and are unlikely to be associated with instrumental systematic\nartifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 May 2004 21:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2004 16:09:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 18:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this\npaper we examine the implications of the hypothesis that, in many globular\nclusters, stars were born in two separate events: an initial burst (first\ngeneration), which gives origin to probably all high and intermediate mass\nstars and to a fraction of the cluster stars observed today, and a second,\nprolonged star formation phase (second generation) in which stars form directly\nfrom the ejecta of the intermediate mass stars of the first generation.

Eleven X-ray sources constitute a well-defined sample of 2 G, 2 K0-K4,\nand 7 M2-M5 stars with median distance around 300 pc. X-ray luminosities are\ntypically log Lx ~ 27 erg/s and is dominated by flares rather than quiescent\ncoronal emission. Models of the population indicates that the CDF-N stars are\nthe most magnetically active old disk stars. A substantial decline in X-ray\nluminosities over the 1<t<11 Gyr age interval is required. This is the first\ndemonstration that the coronal and flaring components of stellar magnetic\nactivity -- and presumably the interior magnetic dynamos responsible for the\nreconnecting fields at the stellar surface -- exhibit long-term decay over the\nage of the Galactic disk.

We consider the kicked harmonic oscillator subject to\nreservoirs that correspond in the classical case to purely dissipative or\npurely diffusive behavior, in a situation that can be implemented in ion trap\nexperiments. In the dissipative case, we derive an expression for the time at\nwhich quantum and classical predictions become different (breaking time) and\nshow that a complete quantum-classical correspondence is not possible in the\nchaotic regime. For the diffusive environment we estimate the minimum value of\nthe diffusion coefficient necessary to retrieve the classical limit and also\nshow numerical evidence that, for diffusion below this threshold, the breaking\ntime behaves, essentially, as in the case of the system without a reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 13:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
