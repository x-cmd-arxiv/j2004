We find that for generic values of the GUT scale\nparameters the modifications are within 10% of the one loop values and can be\nmuch smaller for significant regions of the parameter space. This shows that\ncontrary to longstanding conjectures, high precision calculations are not\nfutile but rather necessary and feasible in the MSGUT. The couplings of the\nmatter supermultiplets are made explicit and used to identify the channels for\nexotic ($\\Delta B\\neq 0$) processes and to write down the associated bare $d=5$\noperators (some of both are novel). The mass formulae for all matter fermions\nare derived. This sets the stage for a comprehensive RG based phenomenological\nanalysis of the MSGUT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 2004 14:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 10:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 17:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2005 13:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-09"}

Our main invariants are the Jones polynomial\n(1984) and its generalizations.\n  In the first section, we discuss the concept of a symmetric knot, and give\none important example -- a torus knot. In the second section, we give review of\nthe Jones type invariants. In the third section, we gently and precisely\ndevelop the periodicity criteria from the Kauffman bracket (ingenious version\nof the Jones polynomial). In the fourth section, we extend the criteria to\nskein (Homflypt) and Kauffman polynomials. In the fifth section we describe r^q\nperiodicity criteria using Vassiliev-Gusarov invariants. We also show how the\nskein method may be used for r^q periodicity criteria for the classical (1928)\nAlexander polynomial.
