Using three\ndifferent sets of assumptions, this null result rules out the existence of the\nfollowing around these post-T Tauri stars: (a) optically-thick disks with inner\nhole radii of ~<0.1 AU, (b) optically-thin disks with masses of >10^{-6}\nM_Earth (in ~1-micron-sized grains) within ~<10 AU of these stars, (c)\nscaled-up analogs of the solar system zodiacal dust cloud with >4000X the\nemitting area.

The field theory contains\nhypermultiplets in the second rank anti-symmetric and in the fundamental\nrepresentations. The Higgs branch has a dual description in terms of gauge\nfield configurations with non-zero instanton number on the world-volume of the\nD7-branes. In this setting the non-renormalisation of the metric on the Higgs\nbranch implies constraints on the alpha' corrections to the D7-brane effective\naction, including couplings to the curvature and five-form field strength.
