In our models, the seesaw scale is stabilized by\nsupersymmetry, implying that the LHC must discover superpartners with a\nspectrum that reflects a low scale of fundamental supersymmetry breaking.\nNewtonian gravity may be modified by effects arising from the exchange of\nfields in the acceleressence sector whose Compton wavelengths are typically of\norder the millimeter scale. There are two classes of models. In the first class\nthe universe is presently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to inflate\nuntil tunneling processes eventually induce a first order transition. In the\nsimplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25\nmicrons in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of order\nunity it is expected to be \\approx 100 microns. In the second class of models\nthermal effects maintain the present vacuum energy of the universe, but on\nfurther cooling, the universe will \"soon\" smoothly relax to a matter dominated\nera. In this case, the range of the new force is also expected to be of order\nthe millimeter scale or larger, although its strength is uncertain. A firm\nprediction of this class of models is the existence of additional energy\ndensity in radiation at the eV era, which can potentially be probed in\nprecision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. An interesting\npossibility is that the transition towards a matter dominated era has occurred\nin the very recent past, with the consequence that the universe is currently\ndecelerating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2004 08:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2004 01:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The speedup overcomes a major objection\nto the standard scenario of low-mass star formation involving ambipolar\ndiffusion, since the diffusion time scale at the average density of a molecular\ncloud is typically longer than the cloud life time. At the same time, the\nstrong magnetic field can prevent the large-scale supersonic turbulence from\nconverting most of the cloud mass into stars in one (short) turbulence crossing\ntime, and thus alleviate the high efficiency problem associated with the\nturbulence-controlled picture for low-mass star formation.

We investigate work\nfluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium\nunder the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability\ndensity P(W) that a work equal to W is exerted upon the system along a given\nnon-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism\nto quantify work fluctuations in the large-size limit. We then define a\ntrajectory entropy S(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories\nP(W)=exp(S(W)/kT) with work equal to W. A trajectory free-energy F(W) can also\nbe defined, which has a minimum at a value of the work that has to be\nefficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this\nformalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays\nthe role of a trajectory temperature. Our solution for P(W) exactly satisfies\nthe fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate\nheat-fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The\nheat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing\nsmall and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the\nstatistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of\nthe exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature.\nFinite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work\ndistributions for finite N are also discussed.

Therefore, the rich variety of\nbehaviors found in the study of the stability of quantum motion under\n``classical'' perturbations has no correspondence in the fidelity of quantum\ncomputation under its natural perturbations. In particular, in this latter case\nit is not possible to recover the semiclassical regime in which the fidelity\ndecays with a rate given by the classical Lyapunov exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2004 07:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is suggested to encode\ninformation in ordinary binary form into many-qubit entangled states with the\nhelp of a quantum computer. A state of qubits (realized, e.g., with photons) is\ntransmitted through a quantum channel to the addressee, who applies a quantum\ncomputer tuned to realize the inverse unitary transformation decoding of the\nmessage. Different ways of eavesdropping are considered, and an estimate of the\ntime needed for determining the secret unitary transformation is given. It is\nshown that using even small quantum computers can serve as a basis for very\nefficient cryptographic protocols. For a suggested cryptographic protocol, the\ntime scale on which communication can be considered secure is exponential in\nthe number of qubits in the entangled states and in the number of gates used to\nconstruct the quantum network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2004 08:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2004 18:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2005 17:14:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 May 2005 12:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
