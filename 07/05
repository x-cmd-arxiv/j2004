Constraints have\nbeen put on the parameter space of these models by calculating the time delay\ndue to propagation in the bulk of particles created during the interaction of\nUltra High Energy Cosmic Rays with protons in the terrestrial atmosphere. The\nquestion was however raised that probability of hard processes in which bulk\nmodes can be produced is small and consequently, the tiny flux of UHECRs can\nnot constrain brane models. Here we use Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model to\nshow that effects of extra dimensions are visible not only in hard processes\nwhen the incoming particle hits a massive Kaluza-Klein mode but also through\nthe modification of soft/semi-hard parton distribution. At classical level, for\nan observer in the CM frame of UHECR and atmospheric hadrons, color charge\nsources are contracted to a thin sheet with a width inversely proportional to\nthe energy of the ultra energetic cosmic ray hadron and consequently they can\nsee an extra dimension with comparable size. Due to QCD interaction a short\nlife swarm of partons is produced in front of the sheet and its partons can\npenetrate to the extra-dimension bulk. This reduces the effective density of\npartons on the brane or in a classical view creates a delay in the arrival of\nthe most energetic particles if they are reflected back due to the warping of\nthe bulk. In CGC approximation the density of swarm at different distance from\nthe classical sheet can be related and therefore it is possible (at least\nformally) to determine the relative fraction of partons in the bulk and on the\nbrane at different scales.

For another,\nCohen-Macaulay rings of Krull-dimension `2' provide us with one of the most\nbeautiful situation in representation theory, which is closely related to\nMcKay's observation on simple singularities. In this sense, usual\nAuslander-Reiten theory should be `2-dimensional' theory, and it be natural to\nfind a setting for higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory from the\nviewpoint of representation theory and non-commutative algebraic geometry.\n  We introduce maximal $(n-1)$-orthogonal subcategories as a natural domain of\nhigher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory which should be\n`$(n+1)$-dimensional'. We show that the $n$-Auslander-Reiten translation\nfunctor and the $n$-Auslander-Reiten duality can be defined quite naturally for\nsuch categories. Using them, we show that our categories have {\\it $n$-almost\nsplit sequences}, which give minimal projective resolutions of simple objects\nof projective dimension `$n+1$' in functor categories. We show that an\ninvariant subring (of Krull-dimension `$n+1$') corresponding to a finite\nsubgroup $G$ of ${\\rm GL}(n+1,k)$ has a natural maximal $(n-1)$-orthogonal\nsubcategory. We give a classification of all maximal 1-orthogonal subcategories\nfor representation-finite selfinjective algebras and representation-finite\nGorenstein orders of classical type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2004 08:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2005 12:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 May 2006 16:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

Chaitin's\n\\Omega is defined as the probability that the universal self-delimiting Turing\nmachine U halts, and plays a central role in the development of algorithmic\ninformation theory. In the theory, there are two equivalent ways to define the\nprogram-size complexity H(s) of a given finite binary string s. In the standard\nway, H(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for U to output\ns. In the other way, the so-called universal probability m is introduced first,\nand then H(s) is defined as -log_2 m(s) without reference to the concept of\nprogram-size.\n  Mathematically, the statistics of outcomes in a quantum measurement are\ndescribed by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) in the most general\nsetting. Based on the theory of computability structures on a Banach space\ndeveloped by Pour-El and Richards, we extend the universal probability to an\nanalogue of POVM in an infinite dimensional quantum system, called a universal\nsemi-POVM. We also give another characterization of Chaitin's \\Omega numbers by\nuniversal probabilities. Then, based on this characterization, we propose to\ndefine an extension of \\Omega as a sum of the POVM elements of a universal\nsemi-POVM. The validity of this definition is discussed.\n  In what follows, we introduce an operator version \\hat{H}(s) of H(s) in a\nHilbert space of infinite dimension using a universal semi-POVM, and study its\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2004 06:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2006 04:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
