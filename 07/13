The jets fire episodically, but often enough that the cuspy\natmosphere does not move very far towards a cooling catastrophe in the\nintervals of jet inactivity. The ability of energy released on the sub-parsec\nscale of the BH to balance cooling on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs\narises through a combination of the temperature sensitivity of the accretion\nrate and the way in which the radius of jet disruption varies with ambient\ndensity. Accretion of hot gas does not significantly increase BH masses, which\nare determined by periods of rapid BH growth and star formation when cold gas\nis briefly abundant at the galactic centre. Hot gas does not accumulate in\nshallow potential wells. As the Universe ages, deeper wells form, and\neventually hot gas accumulates. This gas soon prevents the formation of further\nstars, since jets powered by the BH prevent it from cooling, and it mops up\nmost cold infalling gas before many stars can form. Thus BHs set the upper\nlimit to the masses of galaxies. The formation of low-mass galaxies is\ninhibited by a combination of photo-heating and supernova-driven galactic\nwinds. Working in tandem these mechanisms can probably explain the profound\ndifference between the galaxy luminosity function and the mass function of dark\nhalos expected in the cold dark matter cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2004 16:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Of the three pulsars studied,\nonly PSR B0809+74 shows behaviour completely consistent with the superposition\nof orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), and this only at 328 MHz and in\nsuperposition with an apparently randomly polarized component. The observed\nperiodic pattern is decomposed into the sum of two orthogonally polarized,\nout-of-phase drift patterns, one of which shows a dramatic jump in subpulse\nphase near the leading edge of the pulse window. For PSR B0320+39 and PSR\nB0818$-$13, considerable periodic fluctuations away from OPM orientations are\nseen, a condition that also occurs in the trailing half of the pulse in PSR\nB0809+74 at 1380 MHz. In some cases the deviation is so strong that the\nperiodic locus of the polarization vector in the Poincar\\'{e} sphere is almost\ncircular, in contrast to the strictly colinear states of superposed OPMs.\nSeveral possibilities are discussed for the physical origin of these patterns.\nThe similarity between the subpulse patterns in one of the OPMs of PSR B0809+74\nat 328 MHz to that of the total intensity signal at 1380 MHz supports a picture\nof superposed, out of phase drift patterns. To explain the full range of\nbehaviour seen in the three pulsars, it must be possible to produce at least\nthree arbitrarily polarized superposed patterns.

This structure has recently arisen in the\nstudy of three-dimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings\nof a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in\na $(k,t)$-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear\norderings of the vertex colour classes.

For example, we show how to decrease the number\nof edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of\ntracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts\nand other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric\nthickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and\ntrack-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a\nfunction of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is\nbounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track\nlayouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs\nhave bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar\ngraphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar\ngraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2004 15:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-05"}

Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical precessions\ninduced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and\nthe classical secular N-body precessions which are of the same order of\nmagnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of interest. This\ndefinitely rules out the possibility of analyzing only one orbital element of,\ne.g., Mercury. In order to circumvent these problems, we propose a suitable\nlinear combination of the orbital residuals of the nodes of Mercury, Venus and\nMars which is, by construction, independent of such classical secular\nprecessions. A 1-sigma reasonable estimate of the obtainable accuracy yields a\n36% error. Since the major role in the proposed combination is played by the\nMercury's node, it could happen that the new, more accurate ephemerides\navailable in future thanks to the Messenger and BepiColombo missions will offer\nan opportunity to improve the present unfavorable situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2004 13:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2004 20:17:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 14:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2004 09:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2004 00:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2004 22:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

Given a compact 3-manifold J in M which satisfies\ncertain conditions, Brin and Thickstun have associated to it an open\nneighborhood V$ called an end reduction of M at J. It has some useful\nproperties which allow one to extend to M various results known to hold for the\nmore restrictive class of eventually end irreducible open 3-manifolds. In this\npaper we explore the relationship of V and M with regard to their fundamental\ngroups and their covering spaces. In particular we give conditions under which\nthe inclusion induced homomorphism on fundamental groups is an isomorphism. We\nalso show that if M has universal covering space homeomorphic to R^3, then so\ndoes V. This work was motivated by a conjecture of Freedman (later disproved by\nFreedman and Gabai) on knots in M which are covered by a standard set of lines\nin R^3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2004 18:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2005 17:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2005 20:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}
