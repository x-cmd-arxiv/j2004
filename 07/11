Our\nconsiderations extend to other kinds of flavor changing neutrino reactions as\nwell. We examine non-forward neutrino scattering processes on heavy nuclei and\nfree nucleons in the supernova core. This investigation has led to four\nprincipal original discoveries/products: (1) first calculation of neutrino\nflavor changing cross sections for spin one half (e.g. free nucleon) and spin\nzero nuclear targets; (2) discovery of nuclear mass number squared (A squared)\ncoherent amplification of neutrino-quark FCNC's; (3) analysis of FCNC-induced\nalteration of electron capture and weak/nuclear equilibrium in the collapsing\ncore; and (4) generalization of the calculated cross sections (mentioned in 1)\nfor the case of hot heavy nuclei to be used in collapse/supernova and neutrino\ntransport simulations. The scattering processes that we consider allow electron\nneutrinos to change flavor during core collapse, thereby opening holes in the\nelectron neutrino sea, which allows electron capture to proceed and results in\na lower core electron fraction. A lower electron fraction implies a lower\nhomologous core mass, a lower shock energy, and a greater nuclear\nphoto-disintegration burden for the shock. In addition, unlike the standard\nsupernova model, the core now could have net muon and/or tau lepton numbers.\nThese effects could be significant even for supersymmetric couplings below\ncurrent experimental bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2004 03:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2005 22:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

This paper investigates how big the failure probability can\nbe, before the capability to efficiently find a path in the network is lost.\nOur main results show tight upper and lower bounds for the failure probability\nwhich permits routing, both for the hypercube and for the $d-$dimensional mesh.\nWe use tools from percolation theory to show that in the $d-$dimensional mesh,\nonce a giant component appears -- efficient routing is possible. A different\nbehavior is observed when the hypercube is considered. In the hypercube there\nis a range of failure probabilities in which short paths exist with high\nprobability, yet finding them must involve querying essentially the entire\nnetwork. Thus the routing complexity of the hypercube shows an asymptotic phase\ntransition. The critical probability with respect to routing complexity lies in\na different location then that of the critical probability with respect to\nconnectivity. Finally we show that an oracle access to links (as opposed to\nlocal routing) may reduce significantly the complexity of the routing problem.\nWe demonstrate this fact by providing tight upper and lower bounds for the\ncomplexity of routing in the random graph $G_{n,p}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jul 2004 09:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
