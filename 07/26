Unlike the\nLya forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes and\nheats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the FUV background\nis not sufficient to balance the C II 158um cooling rate inferred from DLAs. In\nthese systems, a local energy source is required. We show that in the case of\nthe z=1.919 DLA toward Q2206-19, the local source is FUV emission from the\nassociated galaxy found by Moller et al (2002): the mean intensity inferred\nfrom photometry is in good agreement with the intensity Jnu required to explain\nthe cooling rate. The FUV mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium\n(CNM) model, Jnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)x10^(-18) cgs (95% c.l.), is the largest expected\nfrom our CII* study of 45 DLAs. This may explain why this is the only confirmed\nDLA yet detected in emission at z>1.9. We argue that in most DLAs with detected\nCII* absorption, Jnu is between 10^{-19} and 10^{-18} and heats the gas which\nis a CNM. By contrast, in most DLAs with upper limits on CII* absorption the\ngas is a warm neutral medium (WNM). Surprisingly, the upper limits are\ncompatible with the same range of Jnu values suggesting the majority of DLAs\nare heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formation\nrates per unit H I area, between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} Msol/kpc^2. We also show\nthat CII* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2004 15:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Necessary statements about quaternion\nmanifolds with quaternion holomorphic transition mappings between charts of\natlases are proved. Unitary representations of these groups including\nirreducible are constructed with the help of stochastic processes and\nquasi-invariant transition measures on groups $G$ relative to dense subgroups\n$G'$. It is proved, that this procedure provides a family of the cardinality\n$card ({\\bf R})$ of pairwise nonequivalent irreducible unitary representations.\nA differentiability of such representations is studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2004 15:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-16"}
