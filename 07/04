I review\ngas transport from the disk to the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of\ngalaxies, as well as the statistical relationships between the occurrence of\nnuclear activity and mechanisms which can cause central gas concentration, in\nparticular bars and interactions. There are strong indications from theory and\nmodelling for bar-induced central gas concentration, accompanied by limited\nobservational evidence. Bars are related to activity, but this is only a weak\nstatistical effect in the case of Seyferts, whereas the relation is limited to\nspecific cases in starbursts. There is no observational evidence for a\nstatistical connection between interactions and activity in Seyferts, and some\nevidence for this in starbursts, but probably limited to the extremes, e.g.,\nULIRGs. Some interesting hints at relations between rings, including nuclear\nrings, and the presence of nuclear activity are emerging. It is likely that the\nconnection between the inflow of gaseous fuel from the disk of a galaxy on the\none hand and the activity in its nuclear region on the other is not as\nstraightforward as sometimes suggested, because the spatial- or time-scales\nconcerned may be significantly different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2004 17:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Recently discovered parabolic arcs in secondary spectra are generic\nfeatures for media that scatter radiation at angles much larger than the rms\nscattering angle. Each point in the secondary spectrum maps particular values\nof differential arrival-time delay and fringe rate (or differential Doppler\nfrequency) between pairs of components in the scattered image. Arcs correspond\nto a parabolic relation between these quantities through their common\ndependence on the angle of arrival of scattered components. Arcs appear even\nwithout consideration of the dispersive nature of the plasma. Arcs are more\nprominent in media with negligible inner scale and with shallow wavenumber\nspectra, such as the Kolmogorov spectrum, and when the scattered image is\nelongated along the velocity direction. The arc phenomenon can be used,\ntherefore, to constrain the inner scale and the anisotropy of scattering\nirregularities for directions to nearby pulsars. Arcs are truncated by finite\nsource size and thus provide sub micro arc sec resolution for probing emission\nregions in pulsars and compact active galactic nuclei. Multiple arcs sometimes\nseen signify two or more discrete scattering screens along the propagation\npath, and small arclets oriented oppositely to the main arc persisting for long\ndurations indicate the occurrence of long-term multiple images from the\nscattering screen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2004 23:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that the translational subgroup of Wigner's little\ngroup for massless particles generate the momentum-space gauge transformations\nin all the Abelian gauge theories considered here. While the defining\nrepresentation of the little group generates gauge transformations in massless\ngauge theories, a different representation is shown to be necessary in the case\nof gauge theories having massive excitations. The analysis of the gauge\ngenerating nature of the translational group is also extended to theories\nliving in higher space-time dimensions. A method named (\\it dimensional\ndescent} is used to systematically derive the polarization vector/tensor and\nthe gauge transformation property of a lower dimensional theory from those of\nan appropriate higher dimensional theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2004 10:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
