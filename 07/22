Exploring the measurement technique of\nfixing the magnetic field and sweeping a front gate voltage (Vg), we are able\nto study the hysteresis by varying the top layer Landau level fillings while\nmaintaining a relatively constant filling factor in the bottom layer, allowing\nus to tackle the question of the sign of Rxx(up)-Rxx(down), where Rxx(up) is\nthe magnetoresistance when Vg is swept up and Rxx(down) when Vg swept down.\nFurthermore, we observe that hysteresis is generally stronger in the even\ninteger quantum Hall effect (IQHE) regime than in the odd-IQHE regime. This, we\nargue, is due to a larger energy gap for an even-IQHE state, determined by the\nLandau level separation, than that for an odd-IQHE state, determined by the\nZeeman splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2004 18:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The property of $J$-unitarity holds on $N$-tuples of $n\\times n$\nskew-Hermitian versus unitary matrices ($n=1,2,...$), and a rational formal\npower series is called \\emph{matrix-$J$-unitary} in this case. The close\nrelationship between minimal realizations and structured Hermitian solutions\n$H$ of the Lyapunov or Stein equations is established. The results are\nspecialized for the case of \\emph{matrix-$J$-inner} rational formal power\nseries. In this case $H>0$, however the proof of that is more elaborated than\nin the one-variable case and involves a new technique. For the rational\n\\emph{matrix-inner} case, i.e., when $J=I$, the theorem of Ball, Groenewald and\nMalakorn on unitary realization of a formal power series from the\nnon-commutative Schur--Agler class admits an improvement: its\nfinite-dimensionality and uniqueness up to a unitary similarity is proved. A\nversion of the theory for \\emph{matrix-selfadjoint} rational formal power\nseries is also presented. The concept of non-commutative formal reproducing\nkernel Pontryagin spaces is introduced, and in this framework the backward\nshift realization of a matrix-$J$-unitary rational formal power series in a\nfinite-dimensional non-commutative de Branges--Rovnyak space is described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2004 14:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 14:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2005 13:37:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2005 14:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We investigate\nthe problem of copying orthogonal, entangled quantum states with an entangled\nblank state under the restriction to LOCC. Throughout, the subsystems have\nfinite dimension D. We show that if all of the states to be copied are\nnon-maximally entangled, then novel LOCC copying procedures based on\nentanglement catalysis are possible. We then study in detail the LOCC copying\nproblem where both the blank state and at least one of the states to be copied\nare maximally entangled. For this to be possible, we find that all the states\nto be copied must be maximally entangled. We obtain a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for LOCC copying under these conditions. For two orthogonal,\nmaximally entangled states, we provide the general solution to this condition.\nWe use it to show that for D=2,3, any pair of orthogonal, maximally entangled\nstates can be locally copied using a maximally entangled blank state.
