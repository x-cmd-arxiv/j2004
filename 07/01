We show\nthat this extinction is likely caused by the presence of metallic needles in\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic center. If the needles\ncontribute only to the 3 - 8 micron extinction, they must have a long\nwavelength cutoff at ~ 8 microns, and therefore a typical length over radius\nratio of about 600, smaller than the 3000 aspect ratio determined for the\nneedles in Cas A. Homogeneously distributed throughout the ISM, they comprise\nonly a minor mass fraction of the ISM, with a needle-to-H mass ratio of\n\\~5x10^{-6}, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the silicate dust mass. Their\ntotal ISM abundance can then be readily explained by the combined production in\nSNe and O-rich stellar outflows. It is currently unclear how universal the GC\nextinction law is. Local 2 - 5 micron extinction measurements seem to be\nconsistent with the standard extinction law, suggesting a non uniform\ndistribution of needles in the ISM. The GC observations show that metallic\nneedles, in spite of their low abundance or non uniform distribution, can be\nthe dominant source of opacity in the 3 - 8 micron wavelength region.

This paper is aimed at reviewing the\nrole of slow TLSs in point contacts. First the theory of point contacts is\nsummarized, concentrating on the discussion of different point contact models,\nand on the different regimes of electron flow in the contact, mainly focusing\non the ballistic and diffusive limit. The Boltzmann equation is solved in both\nregimes, and the position dependence of the electrical potential is determined.\nThen the scattering processes in point contacts are investigated, particularly\nconcentrating on the scattering on slow TLSs. If the the electron assisted\ntransitions between the two states are negligible the electron-two level system\ninteraction can be treated with a simplified Hamiltonian. The scattering on\nsuch slow TLSs causes nonlinearity in the current-voltage characteristics of\nthe point contact, which can be determined using Fermi's golden role. These\ncalculations are presented showing both the contribution of elastic and\ninelastic scattering, and including the dependence on the position of the TLS,\nand on the effect of high frequency irradiation. These results are used to\ndiscuss the differences between these slow TLSs and the fast centers which may\nbe described by the two channel Kondo model. The available experimental results\nare analyzed, distinguishing between the effects due to the different types of\nTLSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2004 15:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The quantum operation studied was the quantum Fourier transform,\nwhich is important in several quantum algorithms and poses a rigorous test for\nthe precision of our recently-developed strongly modulating control fields. The\nresults were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into\ncoherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and\ndecoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a\nsuperoperator consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with\nthe theoretically expected unitary superoperator of the quantum Fourier\ntransform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual\nportion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is\nrequired for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer\nsimulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a\nconsequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography\nprocedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and\ndecoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the\nspectrum of the overall superoperator. The gate fidelity of the experimentally\ndetermined superoperator was 0.64, while the correlation coefficient between\nexperimentally determined superoperator and the simulated superoperator was\n0.79; most of the discrepancies with the simulations could be explained by the\ncummulative effect of small errors in the single qubit gates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2004 19:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
