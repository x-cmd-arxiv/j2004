In contrast to traditional algorithms based on cyclic\ndifference sets, it is possible to construct mask patterns that encode a\npredefined point spread function (PSF). The viability of this approach and the\nreproducibility of the PSFs is examined, together with studies on the mean\ntransparency, pixel-to-pixel variance and PSF deterioration due to partial\nshadowing. Sensitivity considerations suggest the construction of thresholded\nrealisations of Gaussian random fields (TGRF) which were subjected to the same\nanalyses. Special emphasis is given to ray-tracing simulations of the pattern's\nperformance under finite photon statistics in the observation of point sources\nas well as of extended sources in comparison to random masks and the pattern\nemployed in the wide field imager onboard BeppoSAX. A key result is that in\ncontrast to traditional mask generation schemes, coded masks based on GRFs are\nable to identify extended sources at accessible photon statistics. Apart from\nsimulating on-axis observations with varying levels of signal and background\nphoton counts, partial shadowing of the mask pattern in the case of off-axis\nobservations and the corresponding field-of-view is assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2004 14:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The results of\nthe Monte Carlo simulations of signal and background processes show that there\nis a possibility of observing the statistically significant number of signal\nevents required for the discovery.

For a circular configuration of atoms the effective Hamiltonian on\nthe radiationless subspace of the system can be diagonalized analytically. In\nthis case, the radiationless energy eigenstates carry a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum\nnumber $p=0,1, ..., N$ which is analogous to the angular momentum quantum\nnumber $l= 0, 1, ...$, carried by particles propagating in a central potential,\nsuch as a hydrogen-like system. Just as the hydrogen s-states are the only\nelectronic wave functions which can occupy the central region of the Coulomb\npotential, the quasi-particle corresponding to a collective excitation of the\ncircular atomic sample can occupy the central atom only for vanishing\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum number $p$. For large numbers of atoms in a maximally\nsubradiant state, a critical interatomic distance of $\\lambda/2$ emerges both\nin the linear-chain and the circular configuration of atoms. The spontaneous\ndecay rate of the linear configuration exhibits a jump-like \"critical\"\nbehaviour for next-neighbour distances close to a half-wavelength. Furthermore,\nboth the linear-chain and the circular configuration exhibit exponential photon\ntrapping once the next-neighbour distance becomes less than a half-wavelength,\nwith the suppression of spontaneous decay being particularly pronounced in the\ncircular system. In this way, circular configurations containing sufficiently\nmany atoms may be natural candidates for {\\it single-photon traps}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2004 17:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the present paper, we prove that the Werner nonseparable state\nalso belongs to the class of density source-operator states. Moreover, for any\ndimension d>2, the Werner state is in such a subclass of this class where each\ndensity source-operator state satisfies also the perfect correlation form of\nthe original Bell inequality regardless of whether or not the Bell perfect\ncorrelation restriction is fulfilled. The latter earlier unknown property of\nthe Werner state can be verified experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2004 09:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}
