The scaling is seen for a length\nscale range of $2^5$ and is independent of the Rayleigh number, the flux, the\nstrength and nature of the large scale flow, and the aspect ratio. Similar\nscaling is observed for the plume structures obtained in the presence of a weak\nflow across the membrane. This common non trivial spatial scaling is proposed\nto be due to the same underlying generating process of the near wall plume\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 2004 13:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2004 07:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-09"}
