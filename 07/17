This fraction is consistent with cosmological\nsimulations, which also predict that an additional 20-40% of the baryons reside\nin hotter 10^(5-7) K gas, the warm-hot IGM (WHIM). The observed line density of\nLya absorbers, dN/dz = 170 for N(HI) > 10^(12.8) cm^-2, is dominated by\nlow-N(HI) systems that exhibit slower redshift evolution than those with N(HI)\n>10^(14). HST/FUSE surveys of OVI absorbers, together with recent detections of\nO VII with Chandra and XMM/Newton, suggest that 20-70% of all baryons could\nreside in the WHIM, depending on its assumed abundance (O/H = 10% solar). At\nthe highest column densities, N(HI) > 10^(20.3), the damped Lya systems are\noften identified with gas-rich disks of galaxies over a large range in\nluminosities (0.03-1 L*) and morphologies. Lyman-limit systems [N(HI) =\n10^(17.3-20.3)] appear to be associated with bound, bright (0.1-0.3 L*) galaxy\nhalos. The Lya absorbers with N(HI) = 10^(13-16) cm^-2 are associated with\nfilaments of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution, although some\nmay arise in unbound winds from dwarf galaxies. Our discovery that ~20% of\nlow-z Lya absorbers reside in galaxy voids suggests that a substantial fraction\nof baryons may be entirely unrelated to galaxies. In the future, Hubble (and\nFUSE) can provide a census of the local baryons and the distribution of heavy\nelements in the IGM.

There are two sets of\ncharacteristics,corresponding to the fast and Alfven modes. The fast wave is\ngenerally considered to be a transverse light wave, however recently it has\nbeen claimed that light-like fast waves can transport a longitudinal electric\npolarization, $E_{\\parallel}$, at the speed of light. The implication is quite\nprofound if true, namely that the wrong information has been propagated along\nthe fast characteristics in all previous simulations of force-free\nmagnetospheres. It is shown in this Letter that the light-like fast waves must\nbe transverse and previous simulations are valid.

It is shown that the Alfven critical surfaces\nin a ffde magnetosphere are both charge and particle horizons, i.e. one way\nmembranes that do not permit traversal by charges nor particles anti-directed\nto the bulk flow. Since the propagation of a discontinuous change in\n$E_{\\parallel}$ requires a physical surface charge on the wave-face, it is also\na one-way membrane for longitudinally polarized waves.

We have used VLA observations of NH3, CCS, and H2O\nmasers at 1 cm. CCS emission shows three clumps around the central source, with\na velocity gradient from red to blueshifted velocities towards the protostar,\nprobably due to the interaction with outflowing material. Water maser emission\nis elongated in the same direction as a reflection nebula detected at 2micron\nby 2MASS, with the maser spots located in a structure of some hundreds of AU\nfrom the central source, possibly tracing a jet. We propose a new outflow model\nto explain all our observations, consisting of a molecular outflow near the\nplane of the sky. Ammonia emission is extended and anticorrelated with CCS. We\nhave detected for the first time this anticorrelation at small scales (1400 AU)\nin a star forming region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2004 01:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We first show that starting\nwith an arbitrary tetrahedral curve, there is a particular reduction that\nproduces a smaller tetrahedral curve and preserves the even liaison class. We\ncall the curves that are minimal with respect to this reduction S-minimal\ncurves. Given a tetrahedral curve, we describe a simple algorithm (involving\nonly integers) that computes the S-minimal curve of the corresponding even\nliaison class; in the process it determines if the original curve is\narithmetically Cohen-Macaulay or not. We also describe the minimal free\nresolution of an S-minimal curve, using the theory of cellular resolutions.\nThis resolution is always linear. This result allows us to classify the\narithmetically Buchsbaum, non-ACM tetrahedral curves. More importantly, it\nallows us to conclude that an S-minimal curve is minimal in its even liaison\nclass; that is, the whole even liaison class can be built up from the S-minimal\ncurve. Finally, we show that there is a large set of S-minimal curves such that\neach curve corresponds to a smooth point of a component of the Hilbert scheme\nand that this component has the expected dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2004 20:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
