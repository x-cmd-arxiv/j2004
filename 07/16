Consequently, this nuclide provides a unique\ndiagnostic of the history of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The same hadronic\ncosmic-ray interactions also produce high-energy gamma rays (mostly via neutral\npion production). Thus, hadronic gamma-rays and 6Li are intimately linked.\nSpecifically, 6Li directly encodes the local cosmic-ray fluence over cosmic\ntime, while extragalactic hadronic gamma rays encode an average cosmic-ray\nfluence over lines of sight out to the horizon. We examine this link and show\nhow 6Li and gamma-rays can be used together to place important\nmodel-independent limits on the cosmic-ray history of our Galaxy and the\nuniverse. We first constrain gamma-ray production from ordinary Galactic cosmic\nrays, using the local 6Li abundance. We find that the solar 6Li abundance\ndemands an accompanying extragalactic pionic gamma-ray intensity which exceeds\nthat of the entire observed EGRB by a factor of 2-6. Possible explanations for\nthis discrepancy are discussed. We then constrain Li production using recent\ndeterminations of extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB).

Here we\ncarefully consider how multiverses should be defined, stressing the distinction\nbetween the collection of all possible universes, and ensembles of really\nexisting universes, which are essential for an anthropic argument. We show that\nsuch realised multiverses are by no means unique, and in general require the\nexistence of a well-defined and physically motivated distribution function on\nthe space of all possible universes. Furthermore, a proper measure on these\nspaces is also needed, so that probabilities can be calculated. We then discuss\nseveral other major physical and philosophical problems which arise in the\ncontext of ensembles of universes, including the emergence and causal\neffectiveness of self-consciousness, realized infinities, and fine- tuning, or\nthe apparent need for very special initial conditions for our universe --\nwhether they or generalized generic primordial conditions are more fundamental.\nThen we briefly summarise scenarios like chaotic inflation, which suggest how\nensembles of universe domains may be generated, and point out that the\nregularities which must underlie any systematic description of truly disjoint\nmultiverses must imply some kind of common generating mechanism. Finally, we\ndiscuss the issue of testability, which underlies the question of whether\nmultiverse proposals are really scientific propositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2004 08:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 18:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

From optical and near-infrared\nimages of the pair, I measure a separation of 1.44\" and extract RIJHK_s\nphotometry of the components (I_A=17.21, dI=1.07, K_s A=11.97, dK_s=0.84). I\nuse resolved optical spectroscopy to derive spectral types of M7.25 and M8.25\nfor the A and B components, respectively. Based on the strengths of\ngravity-sensitive features in these data, such as the Na I and K I absorption\nlines, I conclude that these objects are young members of Chamaeleon I rather\nthan field stars. The probability that this pair is composed of unrelated\nlate-type members of Chamaeleon I is low enough (~5x10^-5) to definitively\nestablish it as a binary system. After estimating extinctions, effective\ntemperatures, and bolometric luminosities for the binary components, I place\nthem on the H-R diagram and infer their masses with the evolutionary models of\nChabrier and Baraffe, arriving at substellar values of 0.05 and 0.025 M_sun.\nThe projected angular separation of this system corresponds to 240 AU at the\ndistance of Chamaeleon I, making it the first known binary brown dwarf with a\nseparation greater than 20 AU. This demonstration that brown dwarfs can form in\nfragile, easily disrupted configurations is direct evidence that the formation\nof brown dwarfs does not require ejection from multiple systems or other\ndynamical effects. It remains possible that ejection plays a role in the\nformation of some brown dwarfs, but it is not an essential component according\nto these observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2004 13:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The model, which utilizes real material parameters, in\norder to calculate spin dynamics as a function of the gate voltage has been\ndeveloped. From the obtained results we define the efficiency of the spin\npolarization and spin density modulation. The estimated modulation of the spin\npolarization at room temperature is of the order of 15-20%. The results show\nthat the effect is not sufficient for device applications.

The cavity method is a technique that\nrecursively describes the property of a system with N+1 spins in terms of those\nof a system with N spins. To do so, the cavity method assumes a certain degree\nof stability when adding a new spin to the system, i.e. it assumes that for a\ngeneric choice of the parameters there is an one-to-one correspondence between\nthe metastable states of the system with N spins and the metastable states of\nthe system with N+1 spins.

The non-reversible chain achieves this improvement by\navoiding (to the extent possible) transitions that backtrack to the state from\nwhich the chain just came. The proof that this modification cannot increase the\nasymptotic variance of an MCMC estimator uses a new technique that can also be\nused to prove Peskun's (1973) theorem that modifying a reversible chain to\nreduce the probability of staying in the same state cannot increase asymptotic\nvariance. A non-reversible chain that avoids backtracking will often take\nlittle or no more computation time per transition than the original reversible\nchain, and can sometime produce a large reduction in asymptotic variance,\nthough for other chains the improvement is slight. In addition to being of some\npractical interest, this construction demonstrates that non-reversible chains\nhave a fundamental advantage over reversible chains for MCMC estimation.\nResearch into better MCMC methods may therefore best be focused on\nnon-reversible chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 19:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
