The degree of saturation of these resonances is\nimportant in determining whether an eccentric giant planet embedded in a\nprotoplanetary disk experiences an eccentricity excitation or damping. We\nperform calculations restricted to one or two resonances to investigate the\nproperties of two neighboring corotation resonances, as well as the properties\nof a corotation resonance that overlaps a Lindblad resonance. We find that\nthese properties hardly differ from the case of an isolated corotation\nresonance. In particular, although the torque of two neighboring corotation\nresonances may differ from the sum of the torques of the corresponding\nresonances considered as isolated, it never exceeds the sum of the fully\nunsaturated isolated corotation resonances, and it saturates in a fashion\nsimilar to an isolated resonance. Similarly, the presence of an underlying\nLindblad resonance hardly affects the corotation torque, even if that resonance\nimplies a torque strong enough to significantly redistribute the azimuthally\naveraged surface density profile, in which case the corotation torque scales\nwith the resulting vortensity gradient. This set of numerical experiments thus\nessentially validates previous analytic studies. As a side result, we show that\ncorotation libration islands misrepresented by a mesh of too low resolution can\nlead to a strongly overestimated corotation torque.

In the arm\nregion, the gas flows nearly parallel to the arm, and therefore, the magnetic\nfield adopts a similar pitch angle. Between the arms, the gas flows out in\nradius, generating a negative pitch angle in the magnetic field. The intensity\nand direction of the field yield synthetic synchrotron maps that reproduce some\nfeatures of the synchrotron maps of external galaxies, like the islands of\nemission and the displacement between the gaseous and synchrotron arms. When\ncomparing the magnitude of the field with the local gas density, two\ndistinctive relations appear, depending on whether the magnetic pressure is\ndominant. Above the plane, the density structure develops a shape resembling a\nbreaking wave. This structure collapses and rises again with a period of about\n60 Myr, similar to that of a vertical oscillation mode. The falling gas plays\nan important part in the overall hydrostatics, since its deceleration\ncompresses the low z gas, raising the average midplane pressure in the interarm\nregion above that provided by the weight of the material above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 21:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In earlier research we revealed quantum\nstructures in processes taking place in conceptual space. We argue that the\npresence of quantum structures in language and the earlier detected quantum\nstructures in conceptual change make the neo-Darwinian evolutionary scheme\nstrictly too limited for Evolutionary Epistemology. We sketch how we believe\nthat evolution in a more general way should be implemented in epistemology and\nconceptual change, but also in biology, and how this view would lead to another\nrelation between both biology and epistemology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 18:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2004 12:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 17:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-16"}
