Star formation is initiated on large scales by gravitational\ninstabilities which control the overall rate through the long dynamical time\ncorresponding to the average ISM density. Stars form at much higher densities\nthan average, however, and at much faster rates locally, so the slow average\nrate arises because the fraction of the gas mass that forms stars at any one\ntime is low, ~10^{-4}. This low fraction is determined by turbulence\ncompression, and is apparently independent of specific cloud formation\nprocesses which all operate at lower densities. Turbulence compression also\naccounts for the formation of most stars in clusters, along with the cluster\nmass spectrum, and it gives a hierarchical distribution to the positions of\nthese clusters and to star-forming regions in general. Turbulent motions appear\nto be very fast in irregular galaxies at high redshift, possibly having speeds\nequal to several tenths of the rotation speed in view of the morphology of\nchain galaxies and their face-on counterparts. The origin of this turbulence is\nnot evident, but some of it could come from accretion onto the disk. Such high\nturbulence could help drive an early epoch of gas inflow through viscous\ntorques in galaxies where spiral arms and bars are weak. Such evolution may\nlead to bulge or bar formation, or to bar re-formation if a previous bar\ndissolved.

Junctions with a Ni counter electrode and an aluminium oxide\nbarrier showed reproducibly a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect at room\ntemperature of up to 5% with almost ideal switching behavior. This number only\npartially reflects the intrinsic high spin polarization of Fe3O4. It is\nconsiderably decreased due to an additional series resistance within the\njunction. Only SiO2 and Al2O(3-x) barriers provide magnetically decoupled\nelectrodes as necessary for sharp switching. The observed decrease of the TMR\neffect as a function of increasing temperature is due to a decrease in spin\npolarization and an increase in spin-scattering in the barrier. Among the oxide\nhalf-metals magnetite has the potential to enhance the performance of TMR based\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2004 10:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Nevertheless, closer inspection of phase diagrams in\nmany manganites reveals complex phases where the two order parameters of\nmagnetism and charge modulation unexpectedly coexist.

In contrast to models where phase separation originates\nfrom disorder or as a strain induced kinetic phenomenon, we argue that magnetic\nand charge modulation coexist in new thermodynamic phases. This leads to a rich\ndiagram of equilibrium phases, qualitatively similar to those seen in\nexperiment.

Thus the spatial variation of the direction of the spin\ncurrent inside the domain wall results in an adiabatical spin transfer torque\non the magnetization. We show that domain wall motion driven by this spin\ntorque has many unique features that do not exist in the conventional wall\nmotion driven by a magnetic field. By analytically and numerically solving the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation along with the adiabatic spin torque in\nmagnetic nanowires, we find the domain wall has its maximum velocity at the\ninitial application of the current but the velocity decreases to zero as the\ndomain wall begins to deform during its motion. We have computed domain wall\ndisplacement and domain wall deformation of nanowires, and concluded that the\nspin torque based on the adiabatic propagation of the spin current in the\ndomain wall is unable to maintain wall movement. We also introduce a novel\nconcept of domain wall inductance to characterize the capacity of the\nspin-torque induced magnetic energy stored in a domain wall.
