The Chandra data show that the remnant's\nhot, bright projected center is metal-rich and that the bright knots are\nregions of comparatively elevated elemental abundances. The neon abundance is\nelevated, suggesting that the center is rich in ejecta. Furthermore, some of\nthe emitting iron atoms appear to be underionized with respect to the other\nions, providing the first X-ray evidence for dust destruction in a supernova\nremnant. We use the Chandra data to test the following explanations for W44's\nX-ray bright center: 1.) entropy mixing from thermal conduction or bulk mixing,\n2.) cloud evaporation, and 3.) a metallicity gradient, possibly due to dust\ndestruction and ejecta enrichment. In these tests, we assume that the remnant\nhas evolved beyond the adiabatic evolutionary stage, which explains the X-ray\ndimness of the shell. The entropy mixed model spectrum was found to be a good\nmatch to the Chandra spectrum. The bright knots have similar levels of\nionization as the surrounding regions, challenging the evaporating clouds\nmodel. While both of these models are known to predict centrally bright X-ray\nmorphologies, their predictions fall short of the observed brightness gradient.\nThe resulting brightness gap can be largely filled in by emission from the\nextra metals in and near the remnant's projected center. The preponderance of\nevidence suggests that W44's remarkable morphology can be attributed to dust\ndestruction and ejecta enrichment within an entropy mixed, adiabatic phase\nsupernova remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2004 19:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Initially, Rdisk = 40 AU, Mdisk = 0.07 Mo, M* = 0.5 Mo, and Qmin = 1.8.\nSustained cooling, with tcool = 2 orps (outer rotation periods, 1 orp ~ 250\nyrs), drives the disk to instability in ~ 4 orps.

After 12 orps, the disk settles into a quasi-steady state with\nsustained nonlinear instabilities, an average Q = 1.44 over the outer disk, a\nwell-defined power-law Sigma(r), and a roughly steady Mdot ~ 5(-7) Mo/yr. The\ntransport is driven by global low-order spiral modes. We restart the\ncalculation at 11.2 orps with tcool = 1 and 1/4 orp. The latter case is also\nrun at high azimuthal resolution.

We show that,\nusing the analysis of the exact quantum effective action by Intriligator,\nMorrison and Seiberg, these power corrections can be understood as the effect\nof higher-dimension operators. Such operators, both classical and quantum, are\nhighly constrained by gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. As a result, even\nnon-perturbatively large contributions to gauge coupling unification can be\nunambiguously determined within 5d low-energy effective field theory. Since no\nmassive hypermultiplet matter exists in 6 dimensions, the predictivity is\nfurther enhanced by embedding the 5d model in a 6d gauge theory relevant at\nsmaller distances. Thus, large and quantitatively controlled power-law\ncontributions to gauge couplings arise naturally and can, in the most extreme\ncase, lead to calculable TeV-scale power law unification. We identify a simple\n5d SU(5) model with one massless 10 in the bulk where the power-law effect is\nexactly MSSM-like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 13:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2004 18:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2004 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-20"}

This two photon process requires\npair annihilation contributions which are subtle to handle in light-front\ndynamics. We are careful to derive such contributions in the light-front\nBethe-Salpeter formalism. This derivation highlights the connection to the Fock\nspace picture as well as provides a toy model for generalized parton\ndistributions.Ultimately we use light-front dynamics to build a\nphenomenological parametrization for the proton's generalized parton\ndistributions. This task is non-trivial due to the field theoretic constraints\nrequired of these distributions. To meet the constraints imposed by Lorentz\ncovariance, we approach generalized parton distributions from the perspective\nof double distributions. Despite avid phenomenological use, surprisingly little\nwork has been done to calculate double distributions. We first focus on a\nnumber of simple pedagogical examples and demonstrate how double distributions\ncan be correctly determined. The double distributions we derive, including\nthose for the proton, satisfy known constraints and are adequate for\nphenomenological estimates of cross sections. The models used allow one to\nstudy the interplay between the light-front formulation and Lorentz covariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 01:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the present article we discuss the deformation of a\nliquid interface produced by optical radiation forces. Usually, the bending of\nsuch an interface by the radiation pressure of a c.w. laser beam is weak.\nHowever, the effect can be enhanced significantly if one works with a\nnear-critical phase-separated liquid mixture, whereby the surface tension\nbecomes weak. The bending may in this way become as large as several tenths of\nmicrometers, even with the use of only moderate laser power. This\nnear-criticality is a key element in our experimental investigations as\nreviewed in the article.

The model proposes that there exists a quantum process that\nmediates the collective response of a neural lattice (classical brain). The\nmodel is used to explain eye movements when tracking moving targets. Using a\nRecurrent Quantum Neural Network(RQNN) while simulating the quantum brain\nmodel, two very interesting phenomena are observed. First, as eye sensor data\nis processed in a classical brain, a wave packet is triggered in the quantum\nbrain. This wave packet moves like a particle. Second, when the eye tracks a\nfixed target, this wave packet moves not in a continuous but rather in a\ndiscrete mode. This result reminds one of the saccadic movements of the eye\nconsisting of 'jumps' and 'rests'. However, such a saccadic movement is\nintertwined with smooth pursuit movements when the eye has to track a dynamic\ntrajectory. In a sense, this is the first theoretical model explaining the\nexperimental observation reported concerning eye movements in a static scene\nsituation.
