Previous studies of this SNR have shown\nthat it harbors a central X-ray `hot spot' suggestive of a compact object\nassociated with 3C 397. With the Chandra data, we can rule out the nature of\nthe hot spot as a pulsar or a pulsar wind nebula, and put an upper limit on the\nflux of a hidden compact object of F (0.5--10 keV)~6E-13 erg/cm2/s.

The Chandra image reveals arcseconds-scale clumps and\nknots which are strongly correlated with the radio VLA image, except for the\nX-ray hot spot.

Using this residual datacube, we detected the extended\nemission line region associated with the radio jet. We obtained, for the first\ntime, a clean spectrum of this region and found compelling evidences of a\njet-cloud interaction. The jet compresses and splits the gas cloud which is\nionized by the AGN and/or by the strong local UV photon field generated by a\nshock process.

The presence of optical helium lines is\nshown. SN 1990I seems to show higher velocities compared to a sample of type Ib\nevents. The nebular emission lines display a high degree of asymmetry and the\npresence of fine structures. Using the [O I] 6300,64A flux, we estimate a lower\nlimit on the oxygen mass to fall in the range (0.7-1.35) M_solar. The oxygen\nmass requires a filling factor as small as 10^{-2} on day 254, indicating a\nhighly clumpy distribution of the oxygen material. A blueshift of the order 600\nkm/s is reported in the [O I] 6300,64A after day 254. The [Ca II] 7307.5A\nemission profile appears blueshifted as well at late epochs . We recover the\nquasi-bolometric \"BVRI\" light curve of SN 1990I. The constructed bolometric\nlight curve shows a change of slope at late phases, with an e-folding time of\n60 +/-2 d in the [50:200] d time interval, considerably faster than the one of\n{56}Co decay (i.e. 111.3 d), suggesting the gamma-rays escape with lower\ndeposition, owing to the low mass nature of the ejecta. After day 200, an\n$e$-folding time ~47 +/-2.8 d is measured. A simplified gamma-ray deposition\nmodel is applied after adding a contribution of about 35% to the computed\npseudo-bolometric light curves to account for near-IR luminosities to estimate\nthe ejecta and {56}Ni masses (M({56}Ni)=0.11 M_solar and M_{ej}=3.7 M_solar).\nThe deficit in luminosity is estimated to be about 50% around day 308. The\nobserved spectral blueshift combined with the dramatic and sudden drop in the\npseudo-bolometric light curve and (B-V) colour is interpreted to be a\nconsequence of dust condensation in the ejecta of SN 1990I around day 250.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2004 15:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Learning real-time search agents improve their\nperformance over time by acquiring and refining a value function guiding the\napplication of their actions.
