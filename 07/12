The PWN of B0540 shows\na clear asymmetry of the surface brightness distribution along the major axis\nof the PWN torus-like structure with respect to the pulsar position, also seen\nin Chandra X-ray images. This can be linked to the asymmetry of the surrounding\nSN ejecta. We find no significant spectral index variation over the PWN. Using\nHST archival images we estimate the proper motion of B0540 to be 4.9+/-2.3\nmas/yr, i.e. a transverse velocity of 1190+/-560 km/s along the southern jet of\nthe PWN. This can make PSR B0540 the third pulsar with a proper motion aligned\nwith the jet axis of its PWN, which poses constraints on pulsar kick models. We\ndiscuss the interstellar absorption toward B0540 including the contributions\nfrom the Milky Way, LMC and the supernova ejecta, and compare unabsorbed multi-\nwavelength spectra of B0540 and the Crab pulsar, and their PWNs. Compared with\nthe Crab, B0540 and its PWN show a significant depression in the optical range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2004 13:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
