There appears to be a deficiency\nof quiescent LBVs on the S Dor instability strip at luminosities between log\nL/Lsun = 5.6 and 5.8. The upper boundary, is also where the\ntemperature-dependent S Dor instability strip intersects the bistability jump\nat about 21,000 K. Due to increased opacity, winds of early-type supergiants\nare slower and denser on the cool side of the bistability jump, and we\npostulate that this may trigger optically-thick winds that inhibit quiescent\nLBVs from residing there. We conduct numerical simulations of radiation-driven\nwinds for a range of temperatures, masses, and velocity laws at log L/Lsun=5.7\nto see what effect the bistability jump should have. We find that for\nrelatively low stellar masses the increase in wind density at the bistability\njump leads to the formation of a modest to strong pseudo photosphere -- enough\nto make an early B-type star appear as a yellow hypergiant. Thus, the proposed\nmechanism will be most relevant for LBVs that are post-red supergiants. Yellow\nhypergiants like IRC+10420 and rho Cas occupy the same luminosity range as the\n``missing'' LBVs, and show apparent temperature variations at constant\nluminosity. If these yellow hypergiants do eventually become Wolf-Rayet stars,\nwe speculate that they may skip the normal LBV phase, at least as far as their\napparent positions on the HR diagram are concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 20:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The set of all clones on X\nforms a complete algebraic lattice Cl(X). We obtain several results on the\nstructure of Cl(X) for infinite X. In the first chapter we prove the\ncombinatorial result that if X is linearly ordered, then the median functions\nof different arity defined by that order all generate the same clone. The\nsecond chapter deals with clones containing the almost unary functions, that\nis, all functions whose value is determined by one of its variables up to a\nsmall set. We show that on X of regular cardinality, the set of such clones is\nalways a countably infinite descending chain. The third chapter generalizes a\nresult due to L. Heindorf from the countable to all uncountable X of regular\ncardinality, resulting in an explicit list of all clones containing the\npermutations but not all unary functions of X. Moreover, all maximal submonoids\nof the full transformation monoid which contain the permutations of X are\ndetermined, on all infinite X; this is an extension of a theorem by G. Gavrilov\nfor countable base sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 22:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On the basis of the Thomson circulation\ntheorem an implicit integral of the flow equations is constructed. With the\nhelp of this integral, a simple explicit expression for the vortex mode of the\nburnt gas flow near the flame front is obtained. Furthermore, a dispersion\nrelation for the potential mode at the flame front is written down, thus\nreducing the initial system of bulk equations and jump conditions for the flow\nvariables to a set of integro-differential equations for the flame front\nposition and the flow velocity at the front. The developed approach is applied\nto the case of thin flames. Finally, an asymptotic expansion of the derived\nequations is carried out in the case \\theta\\to 1 where \\theta is the gas\nexpansion coefficient, and a single equation for the front position is obtained\nin the second post-Sivashinsky approximation.
