As temperature T\ndecreases, matching features progressively fade out and eventually disappear.\nFurther down in temperature vortex avalanches develop and dominate the magnetic\nresponse.

Based on\ntunable $XXZ$ interactions, we present an architecture for scalable quantum\ncomputers which can fault-tolerantly perform universal quantum computation by\nmanipulating only single type of parameter. By using the concept of\ninteraction-free subspaces we eliminate the need to tune the couplings between\nlogical qubits, which further reduces the technical difficulties for\nimplementing quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2004 05:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Within this formulation of\nquantum mechanics, the resulting description is very elegant from the\ngeometrical viewpoint, since it allows to cast the main postulates of the\ntheory in terms of two geometric structures, namely a symplectic structure and\na Riemannian metric. However, the usual superposition principle of quantum\nmechanics is not naturally incorporated, since the quantum state space is\nnon-linear. In this note we offer some steps to incorporate the superposition\nprinciple within the geometric description. In this respect, we argue that it\nis necessary to make the distinction between a 'projective superposition\nprinciple' and a 'decomposition principle' that extend the standard\nsuperposition principle. We illustrate our proposal with two very well known\nexamples, namely the spin 1/2 system and the two slit experiment, where the\ndistinction is clear from the physical perspective. We show that the two\nprinciples have also a different mathematical origin within the geometrical\nformulation of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2004 06:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 2004 18:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 16:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
