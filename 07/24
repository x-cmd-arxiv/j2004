We show that removal of a black\nhole via radiation recoil generally results in a rapidly-formed central core in\nthe stellar system, with the effect being largest when the hole stays bound to\nthe bulge and the recoil velocity is comparable to the bulge velocity\ndispersion. Black hole recoil therefore provides a mechanism for producing\ncores in some early type galaxies, but it is expected to be most efficient in\nfaint ellipticals that are known to have steep density profiles.

This and\nseveral other experimental observations point to a special role of charge\nasymmetry in superconductivity, which is the foundation of the theory of hole\nsuperconductivity. The theory describes heavy dressed {\\it positive} hole\ncarriers in the normal state that undress by pairing and become light undressed\n{\\it negative} electron carriers in the superconducting state.\nSuperconductivity is driven by kinetic energy lowering rather than by\nelectron-phonon coupling as in BCS. In quantum mechanics, kinetic energy\nlowering is associated with $expansion$ of the electronic wave function, and\nhence we predict: (1) Superconductors expel $negative$ charge from their\ninterior which consequently becomes $positively$ charged; (2) Macroscopic\nelectrostatic fields exist in the interior of superconductors always, and in\ncertain cases also outside near the surface; (3) Macroscopic spin currents\nexist in the superconducting state; (4) Superconductors are 'rigid' with\nrespect to their response to applied longitudinal electric fields.

The Bellman equations are obtained\nfor the case of diffusive and counting measurements for vacuum field states. A\nfull exact solution of the optimal control problem is given for a system with\nsimpler, linear, dynamics. These linear dynamics can be obtained physically by\nconsidering a two-level atom in a strongly driven, heavily damped, optical\ncavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2004 16:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 10:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Alice and Bob initially share a four qubit maximally entangled state\nand by locally manipulating her two qubits Alice can generate 16 orthogonal\nmaximally entangled states, which are used to encode the message transmitted to\nBob. He reads the 4 bit message by a generalized Bell state measurement. A\ngeneralized protocol in which 2N bits of classical information is transmitted\nvia N qubits is also presented. We also show that this four(2N-)partite channel\nis equivalent to two(N) Bell states, which proves that we need two(N) Bell\nstates to teleport a two(N) qubit system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2004 18:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2004 22:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
