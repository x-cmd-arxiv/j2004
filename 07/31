We first critique the\nrationale for hierarchy solution and 4D effective interactions in the\nRandall-Sundrum model.

Matter and massless gravitons both localize when branes form to warp\nspacetime; thus consistent accounting of induced 4D physics must track both\nparticle and Planck scales through brane formation. We perform such\nself-consistent tracking in the warped Randall-Sundrum background, by treating\nmatter as intrinsically extradimensional, on par with gravity, with a unified\nmass scale. We find this definite, self-consistent theory solves two major\nproblems: the effective 4D theory shows robust hierarchy solution, and\npreserves charge universality. Our unified 5D field theory lies at the Planck\nscale; it induces an integrated 4D effective field theory with universal\ncharges, Planck scale 4D gravity, and TeV scale matter. However, this effective\nfield theory describes, not 4D physics on a specific brane, but 4D physics\ninduced by an unobservably small (12 M_{Pl}^{-1}) warped extra dimension.

Here, we present\na novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading\nup to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and\nproteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-a (TGFa), the\ndownstream enzyme phospholipaseC-gamma (PLCg) and a mitosis-associated response\npathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFa secretion, and the\nEGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by\nan extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action\nkinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyze both the\nemergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular\nprofiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed\nsimulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on\nan EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the\nsingle cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system.\nFurthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable\nhypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic\npolarization of PLCg towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient.
