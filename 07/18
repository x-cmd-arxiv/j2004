Applying standard diagnostic techniques as used in previous\nstudies of early-type stars, we find that the X-ray properties of Cyg OB2 No.\n8a are very similar to those of other OB stars that have been observed using\nhigh-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. From analyses of the He-like ion \"fir\"\nemission lines, we derive radial distances of the He-like line emission sources\nand find these fir-inferred radii are consistent with their corresponding X-ray\ncontinuum optical depth unity radii. Contrary to other O-star results, the\nemission lines of Cyg OB2 No. 8a show a large range in line centroid shifts\n(roughly -800 to +250 km/s). We discuss the implications of our results in\nlight of the fact that Cyg OB2 No. 8a is a member of a rather tight stellar\ncluster, and shocks could arise at interfaces with the winds of these other\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2004 19:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
