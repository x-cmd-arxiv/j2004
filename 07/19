Firstly, a much\nbroader range of physically plausible spectral models was used. Secondly, we\nhave utilized a more rigorous statistical analysis. The standard F-distribution\nwas not employed, but rather the exact finite statistics F-distribution was\ndetermined by Monte-Carlo simulations. This approach was motivated by the\nrecent work of Protassov et al. (2002) and Freeman et al. (1999). They\ndemonstrated that the standard F-distribution is not even asymptotically\ncorrect when applied to assess the signficance of additional absorption\nfeatures in a spectrum. With our improved analysis we do not find a third and\nfourth spectral feature (Bignami et al. (2003), De Luca et al.

This\npaper explores one possible regulating mechanism associated with an active\ngalactic nucleus at cluster center. A steady-state model for the intracluster\nmedium is presented in which radiative cooling is balanced by a combination of\nturbulent heating and thermal conduction. The turbulence is generated by\nconvection driven by the buoyancy of cosmic rays produced by a central radio\nsource. The cosmic-ray luminosity is powered by the accretion of intracluster\nplasma onto a central black hole. The model makes the rather extreme assumption\nthat the cosmic rays and thermal plasma are completely mixed. Although the\nintracluster medium is convectively unstable near cluster center in the model\nsolutions, the specific entropy of the thermal plasma still increases outwards\nbecause of the cosmic-ray modification to the stability criterion. The model\nprovides a self-consistent calculation of the turbulent velocity as a function\nof position, but fails to reproduce the steep central density profiles observed\nin clusters. The principal difficulty is that in order for the fully mixed\nintracluster medium to become convectively unstable, the cosmic-ray pressure\nmust become comparable to or greater than the thermal pressure within the\nconvective region. The large cosmic-ray pressure gradient then provides much of\nthe support against gravity, reducing the thermal pressure gradient near\ncluster center and decreasing the central plasma density gradient.

(2004), that the\nrecently-identified Canis Major (CMa) overdensity could be simply explained by\nthe Galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population in\nthe direction of CMa that cannot be explained by known Galactic components. By\nanalyzing the radial distribution of counts of M-giant stars in this direction,\nwe show that the Momany et al. (2004) warp model overestimates the number of\nstars in the Northern hemisphere, hence hiding the CMa feature in the South.\nThe use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology of\nthe overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distance\nof D=7.2\\pm 0.3 kpc. To lend further support to the existence of a population\nthat does not belong to the Galactic disc, we present radial velocities of\nM-giant stars in the centre of the CMa structure that were obtained with the\n2dF spectrograph at the AAT. The extra population shows a radial velocity of\nvr=109\\pm4 km/s, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of the\ndisc at the distance of CMa. This population also has a low dispersion (13\\pm4\nkm/s). The Canis Major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due to\nthe Galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing a\ndisrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. This leads to questions on what part\nof CMa was previously identified as the Warp and how to possibly disentangle\nthe two structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 12:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2004 15:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We use the resulting disk structure to compute the molecular\ntransport coefficients, including the effect of ionization by the central\nobject.

This is related, in particular,\nto the study of nuclear rotation about an axis tilted with respect to the\nprincipal axes of the mass distribution in the Tilted-Axis Cranking (TAC)\nmodel. The present work presents one of the first TAC calculations performed\nwithin fully self-consistent methods. The Hartree-Fock method with the Skyrme\neffective two-body interaction has been used. A computer code has been\ndeveloped that allows for the breaking of all spatial symmetries of the\nsolution. As a first application, calculations for the magnetic bands in 142Gd\nand for the chiral bands in 130Cs, 132La, 134Pr, and 136Pm have been carried\nout. The appearance of those bands is due to a new mechanism of breaking the\nspherical symmetry and to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry,\nrespectively. The self-consistent solutions for 142Gd confirm the important\nrole of the shears mechanism in generating the total angular momentum. However,\nthe agreement with experimental data is not satisfactory, probably due to the\nlack of the pairing correlations in the calculations or to the possibly\noverestimated deformation. The results obtained for 132La constitute the first\nfully self-consistent proof that the nuclear rotation can attain a chiral\ncharacter. It has been shown that the chiral rotation can only exist above a\ncertain critical angular frequency. It has also been checked that the terms of\nthe Skyrme mean field odd under the time reversal have no qualitative influence\non the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 14:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As in previous work on two subsystems we\nintroduce a procedure for checking separability that is based on finding state\nextensions with appropriate properties and may be implemented as a semidefinite\nprogram. The main result of this work is to show that there is a series of\ntests of this kind such that if a multiparty state is entangled this will\neventually be detected by one of the tests. The procedure also provides a means\nof constructing entanglement witnesses that could in principle be measured in\norder to demonstrate that the state is entangled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 14:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we investigate a method for\ncalculating the precise quantum bounds on arbitrary Bell-type inequalities by\nsolving the eigenvalue problem for the operator associated with each Bell-type\ninequality. Thereby, we use the min-max principle to calculate the norm of\nthese self-adjoint operators from the maximal eigenvalue yielding the upper\nbound for a particular set of measurement parameters. The eigenvectors\ncorresponding to the maximal eigenvalues provide the quantum state for which a\nBell-type inequality is maximally violated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2004 09:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
