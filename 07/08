Simulations\nproduce metals self-consistently, based on one single parameter, the metal\nyield, which in turn is constrained by metallicity in the intra-cluster gas. We\nfollow metals as a separate density species. For the metallicity of Lyman alpha\nclouds with column density of N_{HI}~10^{14.5}-10^{15.5}/cm^2 at z=2-4 we find\nreasonable agreement between simulations, both with and without GSW, and\nobservations (Schaye et al). A unique signature and sensitive test of GSW is,\nhowever, provided by lower density regions with gas density of \\rho/<\\rho> =\n0.01-1.0 and a corresponding column density of 10^{12}-10^{14}/cm^2. Without\nGSW we predict that both the mean and median metallicity of \\lya clouds in this\ncolumn density range at z=2-4 should have Z<10^{3}Zsun, since these small\nsystems support little star formation. GSW contaminate these regions, however,\nand also there is a significant fraction (~25%) of Lyman alpha clouds in this\ncolumn density range which have a high metallicity excess of 10^{-2}Zsun,\nresulting in a mean metallicity of ~10^{-2}Zsun. In addition, we find that\nthere is a minimum in the median metallicity for clouds of\nN_{HI}~10^{13}-10^{14}/cm^2 in the case with GSW, whereas without GSW the\nmetallicity decreases monotonically and rapidly with decreasing column density.\nFinally, we predict that the ratio of secondary (e.g., N) to primary metals\n(e.g., O,C) is expected to be smaller by a factor of 10 in clouds of\nN_{HI}~10^{14.5}/cm^2 compared to that in large galaxies; this factor increases\nto >50 for N_{HI}< 10^{13.5}/cm^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2004 19:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2004 03:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The latter\nmethod is often employed to determine the distance to BH LMXBs. A possible\nexplanation for this discrepancy is that the stellar absorption lines in fast\nrotating companion stars are different from those in the slowly rotating\ntemplate stars as was found before for early type stars. This could lead to a\nsystematic mis-classification of the spectral type of the companion star, which\nin turn would yield a systematic error in the distance.

The presence of the two peaks, attributed to (001) and\n(003) reflections, indicates that beta-Ta films exhibit a high preference for\nthe space group of P-421m over P42/mnm, previously proposed for beta-Ta.\nDifferences in relative intensities of (00l) reflections, calculated for single\ncrystal beta-Ta sigma-type Frank-Kasper structure and those measured in the\nfilms, are attributed to defects in the films. Molecular dynamics simulations\nperformed on tantalum clusters with six different initial configurations using\nthe embedded-atom-method (EAM) potential revealed the stability of beta-Ta,\nwhich might explain its growth on many substrates under various deposition\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2004 17:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

When\ndeposition of material is stopped both theories predict that as time tends to\ninfinity, the surface becomes flat. In fact, of course, the final surface is\nnot flat, but simply has no gradients larger than the gradient related to the\nangle of repose. We modify the EW and KPZ to accommodate this feature and study\nthe consequences for the simpler system which is a modification of the EW\nequation.

The situation is quite different from that of EW when deposition\nstops.

The dynamics of the objects below and above Tc are\nexamined in detail with femtosecond spectroscopy and compared with magnetic and\nother measurements. The dynamically inhomogeneous state is described\ntheoretically by considering an interaction between electrons, spins and the\nlattice. By symmetry, only electrons in degenerate states can couple to the\nlattice and spins to give an anisotropic, d-wave symmetry interaction. The\nproposed interaction acts on a mesoscopic length-scale, taking into account the\ninterplay of Coulomb repulsion between particles and anisotropic elastic\nstrain, and leads to the formation of bipolaron pairs and stripes. The\npredicted symmetry breaking associated with pairing and stripe formation are\nobserved in numerous experiments.

It is applicable to direct encryption,\nfor example quantum stream cipher based on Yuen protocol(Y-00), with high\nspeeds and for long distance by sophisticated optical devices which can work\nunder the average photon number per signal light pulse:$<n> = 1000 \\sim 10000$.\nIn addition, it may provide information-theoretic security against known/chosen\nplaintext attack, which has no classical analogue. That is, one can provide\nsecure communication, even the system has $H(K) << H(X)$.\n  In this paper, first, we give a brief review on the general logic of Yuen's\ntheory. Then, we show concrete security analysis of quantum stream cipher to\nquantum individual measurement attacks. Especially by showing the analysis of\nLo-Ko known plaintext attack, the feature of Y-00 is clarified. In addition, we\ngive a simple experimental result on the advantage distillation by scheme\nconsisting of intensity modulation/direct detection optical communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2004 05:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In this case, quantum communication\ncannot help to obtain perfect secrecy with key length smaller then $n$. We\nstudy the question of whether there might still be fundamental differences\nbetween the case where quantum as opposed to classical communication is used.\nIn this direction, we show that there exist ciphers with perfect security\nproducing quantum ciphertext where, even if an adversary knows the plaintext\nand applies an optimal measurement on the ciphertext, his Shannon uncertainty\nabout the key used is almost maximal. This is in contrast to the classical case\nwhere the adversary always learns $n$ bits of information on the key in a known\nplaintext attack. We also show that there is a limit to how different the\nclassical and quantum cases can be: the most probable key, given matching\nplain- and ciphertexts, has the same probability in both the quantum and the\nclassical cases. We suggest an application of our results in the case where\nonly a short secret key is available and the message is much longer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2004 14:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
