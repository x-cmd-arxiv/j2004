The equation of state\nis dominated by the Fermi pressure of an electron-degenerate fluid. The\ndissipation in these simulations is of purely numerical origin. For the\ndimensionless mean rate of dissipation, we find values in agreement with known\nresults from mostly incompressible turbulence simulations. The calculation of a\nSmagorinsky length corresponding to the rate of numerical dissipation supports\nthe notion of the PPM supplying an implicit subgrid scale model. In the\nturbulence energy spectra of various flow realisations, we find the so-called\nbottleneck phenomenon, i.e., a flattening of the spectrum function near the\nwavenumber of maximal dissipation. The shape of the bottleneck peak in the\ncompensated spectrum functions is comparable to what is found in turbulence\nsimulations with hyperviscosity. Although the bottleneck effect reduces the\nrange of nearly inertial length scales considerably, we are able to estimate\nthe value of the Kolmogorov constant. For steady turbulence with a balance\nbetween energy injection and dissipation, it appears that $C\\approx 1.7$.\nHowever, a smaller value is found in the case of transonic turbulence with a\nlarge fraction of compressive components in the driving force. Moreover, we\ndiscuss length scales related to the dissipation, in particular, an effective\nnumerical length scale $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which can be regarded as the\ncharacteristic smoothing length of the implicit filter associated with the PPM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2004 16:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 17:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We clarify that they offer\ncomplementary methods of treating the screening and should serve for different\npurposes. In the GW method, the renormalization of bare on-site Coulomb\ninteractions between 3d electrons occurs mainly through the screening by the\nsame 3d electrons, treated in the random phase approximation (RPA). The basic\ndifference of the constraint-LDA method is that it deals with the neutral\nprocesses, where the Coulomb interactions are additionally screened by the\n``excited'' electron, since it continues to stay in the system. This is the\nmain channel of screening by the itinerant ($4sp$) electrons, which is\nespecially strong in the case of transition metals and missing in the GW\napproach, although the details of this screening may be affected by additional\napproximations, which typically supplement these two methods. The major\ndrawback of the conventional constraint-LDA method is that it does not allow to\ntreat the energy-dependence of $U$. We propose a promising approximation based\non the combination of these two methods. First, we take into account the\nscreening of Coulomb interactions in the 3d-electron-line bands located near\nthe Fermi level by the states from the subspace being orthogonal to these\nbands, using the constraint-LDA methods.

A polyamorphous transition was also detected\nin C60 doped with Kr and He. It is observed that the hysteresis of thermal\nexpansion caused by the polyamorphous transition (and, hence, the transition\ntemperature) is essentially dependent on the type of doping gas. Both positive\nand negative contributions to the thermal expansion were observed in the low\ntemperature phase of the glasses. The relaxation time of the negative\ncontribution occurs to be much longer than that of the positive contribution.\nThe positive contribution is found to be due to phonon and libron modes, whilst\nthe negative contribution is attributed to tunneling states of the C60\nmolecules. The characteristic time of the phase transformation from the low-T\nphase to the high-T phase has been found for the C60-H2 system at 12K. A\ntheoretical model is proposed to interpret these observed phenomena. The\ntheoretical model proposed, includes a consideration of the nature of\npolyamorphism in glasses, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of the\ntransition. A model of non-interacting tunneling states is used to explain the\nnegative contribution to the thermal expansion. The experimental data obtained\nis considered within the framework of the theoretical model. From the\ntheoretical model the order of magnitude of the polyamorphous transition\ntemperature has been estimated. It is found that the late stage of the\npolyamorphous transformation is described well by the Kolmogorov law with an\nexponent of n=1. At this stage of the transformation, the two-dimensional phase\nboundary moves along the normal, and the nucleation is not important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2004 06:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 09:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2004 13:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Lett. 59 (2002), 330--336] the\nvalidity of Greene's method for determining the critical constant of the\nstandard map (SM) was questioned on the basis of some numerical findings. Here\nwe come back to that analysis and we provide an interpretation of the numerical\nresults by showing that no contradiction is found with respect to Greene's\nmethod. We show that the previous results based on the expansion in Lindstedt\nseries do correspond to the transition value but for a different map: the\nsemi-standard map (SSM). Moreover, we study the expansion obtained from the SM\nand SSM by suppressing the small divisors. The first case turns out to be\nrelated to Kepler's equation after a proper transformation of variables. In\nboth cases we give an analytical solution for the radius of convergence, that\nrepresents the singularity in the complex plane closest to the origin. Also\nhere, the radius of convergence of the SM's analogue turns out to be lower than\nthe one of the SSM. However, despite the absence of small denominators these\ntwo radii are lower than the ones of the true maps for golden mean winding\nnumbers. Finally, the analyticity domain and, in particular, the critical\nconstant for the two maps without small divisors are studied analytically and\nnumerically. The analyticity domain appears to be an perfect circle for the SSM\nanalogue, while it is stretched along the real axis for the SM analogue\nyielding a critical constant that is larger than its radius of convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2004 08:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Protein design aims to identify sequences compatible with a given\nprotein fold but incompatible to any alternative folds. To select the correct\nsequences and to guide the search process, a design scoring function is\ncritically important. Such a scoring function should be able to characterize\nthe global fitness landscape of many proteins simultaneously.\n  Results. To find optimal design scoring functions, we introduce two geometric\nviews and propose a formulation using mixture of nonlinear Gaussian kernel\nfunctions. We aim to solve a simplified protein sequence design problem. Our\ngoal is to distinguish each native sequence for a major portion of\nrepresentative protein structures from a large number of alternative decoy\nsequences, each a fragment from proteins of different fold. Our scoring\nfunction discriminate perfectly a set of 440 native proteins from 14 million\nsequence decoys. We show that no linear scoring function can succeed in this\ntask. In a blind test of unrelated proteins, our scoring function misclassfies\nonly 13 native proteins out of 194. This compares favorably with about 3-4\ntimes more misclassifications when optimal linear functions reported in\nliterature are used. We also discuss how to develop protein folding scoring\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2004 18:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
