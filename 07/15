We\nfind that NGC 752 has a solar iron content ([Fe/H]=+0.01+/-0.04), at variance\nwith early reports of sub-solar metallicity. We find that NGC 752 is only\nslightly more Li depleted than the younger Hyades and has a Li pattern almost\nidentical to that observed in the ~2 Gyr old IC 4651 and NGC 3680. As for the\nlatter clusters, we find that NGC 752 is characterized by a tight Li vs. Teff\ndistribution for solar-type stars, with no evidence for a Li spread as large as\nthe one observed in the solar age solar metallicity M 67. We discuss these\nresults in the framework of mixing mechanisms and Li depletion on the main\nsequence (MS). We conclude that the development of a large scatter in Li\nabundances in old open clusters might be an exception rather than the rule\n(additional observations of old clusters are required), and that metallicity\nvariations of the order of ~0.2 dex do not affect Li depletion after the age of\nthe Hyades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 10:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Recent advances in Monte Carlo methods enable efficient\ncalculation of the density of states and related quantities, which renew the\ninterest in them. Here we calculate density of states on the plane (energy,\nmagnetization) for an Ising Model with three-spin interactions on a random\nsparse network, which is a system of current interest both in physics of glassy\nsystems and in the theory of error-correcting codes. Multicanonical Monte Carlo\nalgorithm is successfully applied, and the shape of densities and its\ndependence on the degree of frustration is revealed. Efficiency of\nmulticanonical Monte Carlo is also discussed with the shape of a projection of\nthe distribution simulated by the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 12:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

An optical theorem is used to evaluate the asymmetry in\nterms of the total photoproduction cross section on the proton, predicting its\nmagnitude at a few parts per million for high electon beam energies and small\nscattering angles. At fixed 4-momentum transfers, the asymmetry is rising\nlogarithmically with increasing electron beam energy, following the high-energy\ndiffractive behavior of total photoproduction cross section on the proton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 02:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2005 06:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Real-time\nsingle-shot measurements of the electron bunch structure could provide\nsignificant information about physical mechanisms responsible for generation\nultrashort electron bunches in bunch compressors. The big advantage of proposed\ntechnique is that it can be used to determine the slice energy spread and\nemittance in multishot measurements.

In particular, the question whether the dynamical axiom of QM can be\nderived from other principles has been often considered. In this contribution,\nwe show that unitary evolutions arise as a consequences of demanding\npreservation of entropy in the evolution of a single pure quantum system, and\npreservation of entanglement in the evolution of composite quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 14:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2004 10:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2005 15:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-20"}
