This second way can explain the age spread as\nwell as the dynamical peculiarities observed in some ellipticals, but its\nrelative weight is never dominant and decreases as the ELO mass at the halo\nscale, $M_{vir}$, increases, to such an extent that some recent mergers\ncontributing an important fraction to the total ELO mass can possibly\ncontribute only a small fraction of new born stars.

The distinction between a\nclassical glass and a classical liquid is more difficult, since the glass is\nalso disordered. The difference is in the fact that a glass is frozen while the\nliquid is not. In this article an equilibrium measure is suggested that\ndistinguishes between a glass and a liquid. The choice of this measure is based\non the idea that in a system which is not frozen symmetry under permutation of\nparticles is physically relevant, because particles can be permuted by actual\nphysical motion. This is not the case in a frozen system. In quantum Bose\nsystems there is a natural parameter that can distinguish between a frozen and\na non-frozen state. This is the Bose condensed fraction. In this article it is\nshown how to generalize this concept, in a natural way, to classical systems in\norder to distinguish between the glass and the liquid. A formal similarity\nbetween the ground state wave function of a Bose system and the statistical\nweight function enables a definition of a Bose Einstein condensed fraction in\nclassical systems. It is finite in the liquid and zero in the frozen state. The\nactual value of the condensed fraction in the liquid may serve also as a\nmeasure of the glassiness in the liquid.

The spin relaxation rate\nshows weak mobility dependence and saturates at a level 30 times less then that\npredicted by the Dyakonov-Perel theory. The dynamics of the spin-orbit field\ndiffers substantially from the usual scheme: although all the experimental data\ncan be self-consistently interpreted as a precessional spin relaxation induced\nby a random spin-orbit field, the correlation time of this random field,\nsurprisingly, is much shorter than, and is independent of, the momentum\nrelaxation time determined from transport measurements. Understanding of this\nphenomenon could lead to high temperature engineering of the electron spin\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2004 15:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Some authors use the heavy hadron chiral\neffective theory to evaluate heavy-light quark systems and obtain a reasonable\nevaluation on the masses of D_s(2317) and D_s(2457). An alternative picture is\nto interpret them as four-quark or molecular states. In this work, we are\nfollowing the later and propose a unitive description for all the three new\nmembers D_s(2632), D_s(2317) and D_s(2457) and at least, so far our picture is\nconsistent with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jul 2004 07:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
