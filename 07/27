Finally, we include a\nshort overview of recent attempts to use gauge/string duality in order to\nrelate integrability of Yang--Mills dynamics with the hidden symmetry of a\nstring theory on a curved background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2004 13:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2004 09:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

It is possible to achieve an anisotropy of the manifold which allows\nfor a huge hierarchy between the size of the extra dimension $R$ and the size\nof the observable universe $R_U$ at present. This anisotropy is also at the\norigin of a very peculiar property of our model: the physical distance between\n{\\em any two points} on the brane is of the order of the size of the extra\ndimension $R$ regardless of their distance measured with the use of the induced\nmetric on the brane.

Computer\nProgrammers may think of it as a scrapbook of code snippets that are elegant,\ninstructive, well documented, and useful. Electronics experts may view it as a\ncompendium of circuits for performing a large assortment of tasks. The vast\nmajority of the circuit identities collected in this work were not discovered\nfor the first time by me, and I take no credit for discovering them. In\nproducing this document, I am acting as a collector, not as a discoverer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 2004 12:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
