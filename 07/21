The\ngalaxy models are consistent with the LCDM paradigm of structure formation and\nthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. We\nfind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close SMBH pair\nat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adopted\nforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. Instead, the final SMBH separation in\nunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of the\nmerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. In the absence of dissipation, the\nsatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completed\nleaving its SMBH wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnant\nfor the formation of a close pair. In contrast, we show that gas cooling\nfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companion\ngalaxy to tidal disruption. Moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxies\nconstructed to obey the M(BH)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending on\nwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of the\nmass ratio of the merging systems. Collisionless simulations reveal that\nremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role of\ngas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.\n  In dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associated\nwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by star\nformation provides the necessary fuel to the SMBHs and allows the merger\nremnants to satisfy the relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2004 17:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 19:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The additional gravity is provided for Schwarzschild metric by\nnonluminous mass, whereas for Vaidya metric [1] by emission of radiative\nenergy.

According to the\nresult of our previous work, this dynamic system maximizes this uncertainty in\norder to follow the action principle of mechanics. In this work, this\nmethodology is applied to particle diffusion in external potential field. By\nusing the exponential probability distribution of action (least action\ndistribution) yielded by maximum path information, a derivation of\nFokker-Planck equation, Fick's laws and Ohm's law for normal diffusion is given\nwithout additional assumptions about the nature of the process.

The symmetry can effectively act as the Baryon number up to the\n\\Delta B=3 mod 3 level which is also consistent with the prediction from\nnon-perturbative processes corrections in the SM, such as electroweak instanton\nand sphaleron processes. This symmetry is not consistent with the simple GUTs\nsince those theories explicitly break it. Thus this baryon parity provides a\nstrong hint for new physics like GUTs. Quantum mechanically, we estimate the\ntriple nucleon decay rate which is predicted by the existence of this symmetry.\nWe find a simple U(1) realization with the presence of right-handed neutrinos,\nfrom which this baryon parity can naturally emerge. Gauged R-parity is studied\nin the following chapter. We also study various different approaches to the\nmu-term problem via a symmetry classification. One explicit example in terms of\na Z_4 subgroup of the anomalous U(1) symmetry is given. Another solution arises\nfrom a SUSY version of QCD invisible axion. Discrete flavor gauge symmetries\nare discussed to explain the observed hierarchy fermion masses. D-term\nsplitting problem can then be avoided. In the last part, we show how to use\ndiscrete gauge symmetries to stabilize the QCD invisible axion solutions, for\nboth DFSZ and KSVZ invisible axion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2004 21:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In earlier work of Guijosa and the\nauthor it was shown for the case of two-dimensional de Sitter, there was a\nnatural q-deformation of the conformal group, with q a root of unity, where the\nunitary principal series representations become finite-dimensional cyclic\nunitary representations. Formulating a version of the dS/CFT correspondence\nusing these representations can lead to a description with a finite-dimensional\nHilbert space and unitary evolution. In the present work, we generalize to the\ncase of quantum-deformed three-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and compute the\nentanglement entropy of a quantum field across the cosmological horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2004 13:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2004 17:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Each of these\nlocal operations can be verified by measuring a corresponding truth table of\nfour local inputs and four local outputs. The quantum parallelism of the gate\ncan then be observed directly in a set of three simple experimental tests, each\nof which has a clear intuitive interpretation in terms of classical logical\noperations. Specifically, quantum parallelism is achieved if the average\nfidelity of the three classical operations exceeds 2/3. It is thus possible to\nevaluate the essential quantum parallelism of an experimental controlled-NOT\ngate by testing only three characteristic classical operations performed by the\ngate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2004 02:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 06:44:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2005 09:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
