We take into account the possibility of a non-viscous energy\nrelease in the gravitationally unstable region of the disc.

Using the theoretical modeling given in literature and\nthe reasonable choice of relevant parameters, we calculate the expected light\ncurve due to the regeneration mechanism. As the result, we find that the\nregenerated emission could only slightly change the original light curve, even\nif we take a rather large value for the CIB density, independently of the\ndensity profile of surrounding medium, i.e., constant or wind-like profile.\nThis ensures us the reliable estimation of the intrinsic GRB parameters when\nthe high-energy observation is accessible, regardless of a large amount of\nuncertainty concerning the CIB density as well as extragalactic magnetic field\nstrength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 05:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

While such an\nassumption may be valid in many circumstances, an explicit form of FP equation\nis not always available. In our computations we bypass the analytic derivation\nof such an effective FP equation. The effective free energy gradient and the\nstate-dependent magnitude of the random noise, which are necessary to formulate\nthe effective Fokker-Planck equation, are obtained from ensembles of short\nbursts of microscopic simulations {\\it with judiciously chosen initial\nconditions}.

In contrast to the usual gauge-fixed\ntreatment, the sigma model point of view provides a safe framework in which\ncalculation are tractable while keeping a full control of gauge-invariance. It\nshows that the non-local massive Yang--Mills action is naturally associated\nwith the low-energy description of QCD in the Chiral Perturbation Theory\napproach. Moreover, the sigma model admits solutions called center vortices\nfamiliar in different (de)-confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scenarios.\nThis suggests that the non-local operator introduced by Gubarov, Stodolsky, and\nZakharov might be sensitive to center vortices configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 12:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\ntwo-step model of radiobiological mechanism proposed recently by Judas and\nLokajicek (Judas L., Lokajicek M., 2001: Cell inactivation by ionizing\nparticles and the shapes of survival curves. J. Theor. Biol. 210 (1), 15-21.,\ndoi:10.1006/jtbi.2001.2283) has then enabled to show that some significant\ndeviations from the generally used linear-quadratic model should exist at\nhigher values of linear energy transfer, which has been also demonstrated\nexperimentally. However, the new model has been expressed in the form being\napplicable rightfully to low-dose parts of survival curves only. It has been\nnow reformulated to be applicable in analyses of whole survival curves.\nInactivation probabilities after different numbers of particles traversing cell\nnuclei (chromosomal systems) may be then derived from experimental data.\nAnalyses of published data obtained in irradiating by protons and deuterons\nwill be presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 11:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In mammalian\ncells, clustering of receptors may be facilitated by heterogeneous zones of\nlipids, known as lipid rafts. In vitro experiments show that disruption of\nrafts significantly alters the dissociation of fibroblast growth factor-2\n(FGF-2) from heparan sulfate proteoglycans, co-receptors for FGF-2. In this\npaper, we develop a continuum stochastic formalism in order to (i) study how\nrebinding affects the dissociation of ligands from a planar substrate, and (ii)\naddress the question of how receptor clustering influences ligand rebinding. We\nfind that clusters reduce the effective dissociation rate dramatically when the\nclusters are dense and the overall surface density of receptors is low. The\neffect is much less pronounced in the case of high receptor density and shows\nnon-monotonic behavior with time. These predictions are verified via lattice\nMonte Carlo simulations. Comparison with experimental results suggests that the\ntheory does not capture the complete biological system. We speculate that\nadditional co-operative mechanisms might be present in order to increase ligand\nretention, and present one possible ``internal diffusion'' model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2004 18:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2005 11:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 11:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2005 19:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To address these\nshortcomings, \\emph{ad hoc} 2D mappings, where the second variable is a\n``memory'' variable, have been proposed; it seems that these models exhibit\nsome, but not all, of the relevant behavior. In this paper we introduce a new\n2D mapping and determine a set of parameters for it that gives a rather\naccurate description of the full restitution portrait found for one animal. The\nchanges in the mapping, compared to previous models, result from requiring that\nthe mapping can be derived as an asymptotic limit of a simple ionic model.\nAmong other benefits, one can interpret the parameters in the mapping in terms\nof the ionic model. The ionic model is an extension of a two-current model that\nadds a third dependent variable, a generalized concentration. The simplicity of\nthe ionic model and the physiological basis for the mapping contribute to the\nusefulness of these ideas for describing restitution data in a variety of\ncontexts. The fitting procedure is straightforward and can easily be applied to\nobtain a mathematical model for data from other experiments, including\nexperiments on different species. Uniqueness of the parameter choice is also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 13:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
