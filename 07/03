The correlation can partly be related to the galaxies'\nluminosities: the brightest galaxies tend to be more active and less\nrotationally supported. However, even at lower luminosities the active and\ninactive galaxies seem to have systematically different dynamics. This\nvariation suggests that there are significant large-scale structural\ndifferences between active and inactive elliptical galaxies, and hence that the\nexistence of both types of system cannot just be the result of random sporadic\nnuclear activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 16:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This ``hot\nbrake'' flow forms in the two-temperature zone (close to a central object), but\nat a sufficiently low accretion rate and a high spin it may extend in the\nradial direction beyond ~300 Schwarzchild radii into a one-temperature zone.\nWhen the spin of the star is small enough, the flow transforms smoothly to an\nadvection-dominated accretion flow. All gas parameters (density, angular\nvelocity, temperature, luminosity, angular momentum flux) except for the radial\nvelocity are independent of the mass accretion rate. The radiative efficiency\nmay be arbitrarily large as M-dot -> 0. The gas angular momentum is transported\noutward under most conditions, hence the central star is nearly always\nspun-down. The flow is convectively stable. We also find that themal conduction\nin the flow is strong enough to make the flow thermally stable. The very fact\nthat the density, temperature and angular velocity of the gas at any radius in\nthe hot brake flow are completely independent of the outer and inner (except\nfor the star spin) boundary conditions implies that the flow cannot be smoothly\nmatched to a general external medium as well as to general conditions on the\nstar surface.

Based on the empirical linear\nrising of the mass of a hadron with the number of constituent quarks which\nyields a mass around $1.4 $GeV for tetraquarks, we conjecture that this\ncuasi-chiral nonet arises from the mixing of a chiral nonet composed of\ntetraquarks with conventional bar{q}q states. We explore this possibility in\nthe framework of a chiral model assuming a tetraquark chiral nonet around 1.4\nGeV with chiral symmetry realized directly. We stress that U_{A}(1)\ntransformations can distinguish bar{q}q from tetraquark states, although it\ncannot distinguish specific dynamics in the later case. We find that the\nmeasured spectrum is consistent with this picture. In general, pseudoscalar\nstates arise as mainly bar{q}q states but scalar states turn out to be strong\nadmixtures of bar{q}q and tetraquark states. We work out also the model\npredictions for the most relevant couplings and calculate explicitly the strong\ndecays of the a_{0}(1450) and K_{0}^*(1430) mesons.

The\ntheory is treated as a constrained system in the contexts of the\nFaddeev-Jackiw, the symplectic, as well as the master Lagrangian approaches. We\nexhibit the master Lagrangian nature of the model from which generalizations of\nthe sine-Gordon (GSG) or the massive Thirring (GMT) models are derivable. The\nGMT model describes $N_{f}=3$ [number of positive roots of $su(3)$] massive\nDirac fermion species with current-current interactions amongst all the U(1)\nspecies currents; on the other hand, the GSG theory corresponds to $N_{b}=2$\n[rank of the $su(3)$ Lie algebra] independent Toda fields (bosons) with a\npotential given by the sum of three SG cosine terms.

Such an extension could be\nan important tool for understanding processes such as cancer development and\nstem cell growth. Starting from the quasispecies dynamics over the space of\ngenomes, we derive an equivalent dynamics over the space of ordered sequence\npairs. From this set of equations, we are able to derive the infinite sequence\nlength form of the dynamics for a class of ``master-genome''-based fitness\nlandscapes. We use these equations to solve for a ``generalized''\nsingle-fitness-peak landscape, where the master genome can sustain a maximum\nnumber of lesions and remain viable. The central pattern that emerges from our\nstudies is that imperfect lesion repair often leads to increased mutational\nrobustness over semiconservative replication with completely efficient lesion\nrepair. The reason for this is that imperfect lesion repair breaks some of the\ncorrelation between the parent and daughter strands, thereby preventing\nreplication errors from destroying the information in the original genome. The\nresult is a delayed error catastrophe over that expected from the original\nsemiconservative quasispecies model. In particular, we show that when only of\nthe strands is necessary for conferring viability, then, when lesion repair is\nturned off, a semiconservatively replicating system becomes an effectively\nconservatively replicating one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2004 21:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The first FT-NIR chemical images of biological systems approaching\n1micron resolution are here reported. 400 and 500 MHz, H-1 NMR analyses were\ncarried out that allowed the selection of mutagenized embryos. Detailed\nchemical analyses are being demonstrated to be also possible by FT-NIR Chemical\nImaging/ Microspectroscopy of single cancer cells. FT-NIR Microspectroscopy and\nChemical Imaging are also shown to be potentially important in Functional\nGenomics and Proteomics research through the rapid and accurate detection of\nhigh-content microarrays (HCMA). Multi-photon (MP), pulsed femtosecond laser\nNIR Fluorescence Excitation techniques were shown to be capable of Single\nMolecule Detection (SMD. Thus, MP NIR excitation for Fluorescence Correlation\nSpectroscopy (FCS) allowed not only single molecule detection, but also\nmolecular dynamics observations and high resolution, submicron imaging of\nsub-femtoliter volumes inside living cells with 0.25 micron spatial resolution,\nin both normal and cancer cells, as well as neoplastic tissues. These novel,\nultra-sensitive and rapid FT-NIR/FCS analyses have, therefore, substantial\npotential for numerous applications in important research areas, such as:\nmedicine, medical/cancer research, pharmacology, agricultural biotechnology,\nfood safety, as well as clinical diagnosis of viral diseases and cancers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2004 04:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
