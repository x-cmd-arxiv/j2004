Assuming the coupling constants at the\ntime of inflation depend on some light moduli fields, we encounter the\ngeneration of modulated cosmological fluctuations from (p)reheating. This is an\nalternative mechanism to generate observable (almost) scale free adiabatic\nmetric perturbations. We extend this idea to the class of hybrid inflation,\nwhere the bifurcation value of the inflaton is modulated by the spatial\ninhomogeneities of the couplings. As a result, the symmetry breaking after\ninflation occurs not simultaneously in space but with the time laps in\ndifferent Hubble patches inherited from the long-wavelength moduli\ninhomogeneities. To calculate modulated fluctuations we introduce techniques of\ngeneral relativistic matching conditions for metric perturbations at the time\nhypersurface where the equation of state after inflation undergoes a jump,\nwithout evoking the detailed microscopic physics, as far as it justifies the\njump. We apply this theory to the modulated fluctuations from the hybrid and\nchaotic inflations. We discuss what distinguish the modulated from the\ninflation-driven fluctuations, in particular, their spectral index,\nmodification of the consistency relation and the issue of weak non-Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 18:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The yields of our fits to the global spectrum\nconfirm that 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an SN Ia and show a clear preference\nfor delayed detonation explosion models for SNe Ia. We study the spectrum of\nthe single brightest isolated knot in the remnant and find that it is enhanced\nin iron by a factor of roughly two relative to the global remnant abundances.\nThis feature, along with similar knots seen in Tycho's SNR, argues for the\npresence of modest small-scale composition inhomogeneities in SNe Ia. The\npresence of both Si and Fe, with abundance ratios that vary from knot to knot,\nindicates that these came from the transition region between the Si- and\nFe-rich zones in the exploded star, possibly as a result of energy input to the\nejecta at late times due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co. Two cases\nfor the continuum emission from the global spectrum were modeled: one where the\ncontinuum is dominated by hydrogen thermal bremsstrahlung radiation; another\nwhere the continuum arises from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The former\ncase requires a relatively large value for the ambient density (~1 cm^-3).\nAnother estimate of the ambient density comes from using the shell structure of\nthe remnant in the context of dynamical models.

Gladman et al. (2001) showed that this objects could not have been a\nnormal member of the scattered disk that had its perihelion distance increased\nby chaotic diffusion. In this paper we explore four seemingly promising\nmechanisms for explaining the origin of the orbit of this peculiar object: (i)\nthe passage of Neptune through a high-eccentricity phase, (ii) the past\nexistence of massive planetary embryos in the Kuiper belt or the scattered\ndisk, (iii) the presence of a massive trans-Neptunian disk at early epochs\nwhich exerted tides on scattered disk objects, and (iv) encounters with other\nstars. Of all these mechanisms, the only one giving satisfactory results is the\npassage of a star. Indeed, our simulations show that the passage of a solar\nmass star at about 800 AU only perturbs objects with semi-major axes larger\nthan roughly 200 AU to large perihelion distances. This is in good agreement\nwith the fact that 2000 CR105 has a semi-major axis of 230AU and no other\nbodies with similar perihelion distances but smaller semi-major axes have yet\nbeen discovered.

Recently, it was proposed that the origin of the\nmodulations is electronic charge ordered phases intrinsic to doped Mott\ninsulators. We show that even if the system has not charge ordered, proximity\nto such an order will induce modulations at the same ordering wavevector. Such\nmodulations are a signature of the real or incipient order. We construct ground\nstate wavefunctions that include strong fluctuations of the competing order\nwithout having ordered. They exhibit deep roton minima at wavevectors of the\nreciprocal lattice of the incipient order due to proximity to the phase\ntransition into the charge ordered state. Such minima, in turn, produce strong\nmodulations. Moreover, the effects are generic and are present whenever an\nelectronic system is near a crystalline phase.

Here we establish conditions under which the Atiyah\nconjecture for a group G implies the Atiyah conjecture for every finite\nextension of G. The most important requirement is that the cohomology\n$H^*(G,\\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the p-adic completion\nof G for every prime p.

A sufficient condition for a coring to be isomorphic to an infinite\ncomatrix coring is found. We deduce in particular that any coalgebra over a\nfield and the coring associated to a group-graded ring are isomorphic to\nadequate infinite comatrix corings. We also characterize when the free module\ncanonically associated to a (not necessarily finite) set of group like elements\nis Galois.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 17:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Method and results: We present a novel strategy for analysing\nprotein-coding sequence by first randomizing the codons used at each position\nwithin the coding sequence, then applying a motif-based machine learning\nalgorithm to compare the true and randomized sequences. This strategy\nidentified a collection of motifs which can successfully discriminate between\nreal and randomized coding sequence, including -- but not restricted to --\nseveral previously reported splice enhancer elements. As well as successfully\ndistinguishing coding exons from randomized sequences, we show that our model\nis able to recognize non-coding exons. Conclusions: Our strategy succeeded in\ndetecting signals in coding exons which seem to be orthogonal to the sequences'\nprimary function of coding for proteins. We believe that many of the motifs\ndetected here may represent binding sites for previously unrecognized proteins\nwhich influence RNA splicing. We hope that this development will lead to\nimproved knowledge of exonic splice enhancers, and new developments in the\nfield of computational gene prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 13:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult\nbecause of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major\ncomplication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between\nthe quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum\ncircuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is\npotentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the\ncomputational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time\nand memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the\nnumber of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that\nexplicitly store the density matrix intractable. In this work, we propose a new\ntechnique aimed at efficiently simulating quantum circuits that are subject to\nerrors. In particular, we describe new graph-based algorithms implemented in\nthe simulator QuIDDPro/D. While previously reported graph-based simulators\noperate in terms of the state-vector representation, these new algorithms use\nthe density matrix representation. To gauge the improvements offered by\nQuIDDPro/D, we compare its simulation performance with an optimized array-based\nsimulator called QCSim. Empirical results, generated by both simulators on a\nset of quantum circuit benchmarks involving error correction, reversible logic,\ncommunication, and quantum search, show that the graph-based approach far\noutperforms the array-based approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 06:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 21:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
