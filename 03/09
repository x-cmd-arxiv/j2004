This work offers alternative,\nphysically motivated definitions for the parameters c, G, and h based on the\nMachian premise that these dimensional quantities reflect global dynamics of\nthe expansion geometry. Together with a postulated conservation law and\nequations of motion, the implications of this theory for Friedmann models are\nexamined, and found to yield several interesting conclusions including: (1)\nnatural solutions to the horizon, flatness, and lambda problems, (2) the\nprediction of a flat, Omega_0 = 1 universe, (3) different forms for some\ncosmological scaling laws, (4) an apparent fit to observations of Type Ia\nsupernovae without invoking a cosmological constant, (5) equivalence between\nour Universe and a black hole and apparent consistency of the model with the\nHolographic Principle, and (6) potentially testable predictions for the time\nvariation of physical parameters, including values for c_dot and h_dot that are\nsmall but non-zero today and a value for G_dot that was negative and nonzero\nduring radiation domination and decayed to effectively zero upon the epoch of\nmatter domination.

During five months of observations the star went into three\nsuperoutbursts and seven ordinary outbursts. This allowed us to determine its\nsupercycle and cycle lengths as equal to 54 +/- 1 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 days,\nrespectively. During the Sep 2003 superoutburst, which had the best\nobservational coverage, IX Dra displayed clear superhumps with a period of\nPsh=0.066968(17) days. This period was constant during the whole superoutburst.\nAnother period, which was clearly present in the light curve of IX Dra in\nsuperoutburst, had a value of 0.06646(6) days and we interpret it as the\norbital period of the binary. Thus IX Dra is the first SU UMa star showing\norbital modulation during the entire superoutburst. The beat between these two\nperiods is the main cause of an unusual phase reversal of superhumps - a\nphenomenon which was previously observed in ER UMa. If our interpretation of\nthe second periodicity is correct, IX Dra has an extremely low period excess\n$\\epsilon$ equal to only 0.76% +/- 0.03%. This implies very low mass ratio\nq=0.035 +/- 0.003, which strongly suggests that the system contains a brown\ndwarf-like degenerate secondary of mass ~0.03 Mo and that IX Dra is the most\nevolved dwarf nova known. Such a very low mass ratio results in the outer edge\nof the accretion disk reaching 80% of the distance between the components of\nthe system. In turn, this allows the disk particles to enter a 2:1 resonance\nand leads to the appearance of the orbital period in the light curve of the\nentire superoutburst.The high level of activity and brightness of IX Dra\nindicate that very old cataclysmic variables go through episodes of increased\nactivity leading to loss of angular momentum through mass loss from the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2004 13:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such a tensor field $B_{AB}$ (whose rank-3 field\nstrength tensor is $H_{LMN}$), which appears in the massless sector of a\nheterotic string theory, is assumed to coexist with the gravity in the bulk.\nThe third rank field strength corresponding to the Kalb-Ramond field has a\nwell-known geometric interpretation as the spacetime torsion. The only\nnon-trivial classical solutions corresponding to the effective four-dimensional\naction are found to be self-dual or anti-selfdual Kalb-Ramond fields. This\nensures that the four-dimensional effective action on the brane is\nparity-conserving. The massive modes for both cases, lying in the TeV range,\nare related to the fundamental parameters of the theory. These modes can be\nwithin the kinematic reach of forthcoming TeV scale experiments. However, the\ncouplings of the massless as well as massive Kalb-Ramond modes with matter on\nthe visible brane are found to be suppressed vis-a-vis that of the graviton by\nthe warp factor, whence the conclusion is that both the massless and the\nmassive torsion modes appear much weaker than curvature to an observer on the\nvisible brane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2004 09:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The exception that they\nmention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being\nsymmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The\nmotivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V\nand V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological\ndelooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and\nsymmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et\nal in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv. Math. 176(2003) 277-349]. It seems\nthat the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept\nof enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal\ncategories and their higher dimensional counterparts. The main result is that\nfor V a k-fold monoidal category, V-Cat becomes a (k-1)-fold monoidal\n2-category in a canonical way. In the next paper I indicate how this process\nmay be iterated by enriching over V-Cat, along the way defining the 3-category\nof categories enriched over V-Cat. In future work I plan to make precise the\nn-dimensional case and to show how the group completion of the nerve of V is\nrelated to the loop space of the group completion of the nerve of V-Cat.\n  This paper is an abridged version of `Enrichment as categorical delooping I'\nmath.CT/0304026.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2004 11:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

A complete theory of wave packets scattering on a fixed\ncenter is presented, and its similarity to the plane wave scattering is\ndemonstrated. The neutron scattering on a monatomic gas is investigated, and\nseveral problems are pointed out. A catastrophic ambiguity of the cross section\nis revealed, and a way to resolve this ambiguity is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2004 09:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2004 13:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2005 10:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2006 14:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2006 13:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 11:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2004 10:16:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 13:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 16 May 2004 15:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 13:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2004 12:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 09:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 12:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our\nproblem, QSCDff, is to distinguish between two types of random coset states\nwith a hidden permutation over the symmetric group of finite degree. This\nnaturally generalizes the commonly-used distinction problem between two\nprobability distributions in computational cryptography. As our major\ncontribution, we show that QSCDff has three properties of cryptographic\ninterest: (i) QSCDff has a trapdoor; (ii) the average-case hardness of QSCDff\ncoincides with its worst-case hardness; and (iii) QSCDff is computationally at\nleast as hard as the graph automorphism problem in the worst case. These\ncryptographic properties enable us to construct a quantum public-key\ncryptosystem, which is likely to withstand any chosen plaintext attack of a\npolynomial-time quantum adversary. We further discuss a generalization of\nQSCDff, called QSCDcyc, and introduce a multi-bit encryption scheme that relies\non similar cryptographic properties of QSCDcyc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2004 09:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2004 08:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2005 09:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 09:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2006 11:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2011 02:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

However, in many quantum algorithms, the smaller\nsize of the AQFT circuit yields a net improvement over using the QFT.\n  This paper presents a more thorough analysis of the AQFT circuit, which leads\nto the surprising conclusion that for sufficiently large input sizes, the\ndifference between the QFT and the logarithmic-depth AQFT is negligible.
