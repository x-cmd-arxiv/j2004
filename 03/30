The structure function of RM fluctuations shows a relatively\nsteep slope at small scales (1-5 arcmin), a break in slope to a flatter\nstructure function at intermediate scales (5-60 arcmin), and a systematic\nvariation of the strength of fluctuations as a function of position angle on\nthe sky at the largest scales (60-200 arcmin). The structure function of EM\nfluctuations shows similar behavior, although the lower resolution of the data\nprevents detection of a possible break in the spectrum. We interpret the\nanisotropy in RM/EM structure on large scales as resulting from a large-scale\ngradient in electron density (and possibly magnetic field) across the region.\nThe break in the slope of the RM structure function at scales of about 5 arcmin\ncan be explained by contributions from two spatially distinct magneto-ionized\nscreens, most likely in the Local and Carina spiral arms. The observed\nstructure function then implies that the outer scale of RM fluctuations in\nthese screens is about 2 pc.

The most likely source of such turbulence is\nindividual HII regions from relatively low-mass stars, whose characteristic\nscale size is similar to the outer scale of turbulence inferred here.

The minimal cooling\nscenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to\ninclude neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process.\nThis emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures\nclose to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is\ndistinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from\nany direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the\nminimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a\nfour parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter,\nsuperfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star\nenvelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are\nexplored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared\nwith the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to\nascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which\nthermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent\nwith the lack of enhanced cooling.

In doing so, we demonstrate that most, if not\nall, so-called ``power-law'' galaxies are better described as ``Sersic\ngalaxies'' -- they are well modeled by the three-parameter Sersic profile into\nthe limits of HST resolution -- and that ``core'' galaxies are best understood\nas consisting of an outer Sersic profile with an inner power-law cusp, which is\na downward deviation from the inward extrapolation of the Sersic profile.

Undoped CoO2 is a charge transfer\ninsulator within LSDA+U and a metal with a high density of states (DOS) at the\nFermi level within LSDA. (CoO2)$^{1.0-}$, on the other hand, is a band\ninsulator with a gap of 2.2 eV. Systems with fractional doping are metals if no\ncharge orderings are present. Due to the strong interaction between the doped\nelectron and other correlated Co d electrons, the calculated electronic\nstructure of (CoO2)$^{x-}$ depends sensitively on the doping level x. Zone\ncenter optical phonon energies are calculated under the frozen phonon\napproximation and are in good agreement with measured values. Softening of the\n$E_g$ phonon at doping x ~0.25 seems to indicate a strong electron-phonon\ncoupling in this system. Possible intemediate spin states of Co ions, Na\nordering, as well as magnetic and charge orderings in this system are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2004 19:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

After introducing a gauge-invariant formalism for the generic\nmetric perturbations of these backgrounds, we focus on modes which are scalar\nwith respect to dS_4. The physical eigenmasses of these modes acquire a large\nuniversal tachyonic contribution -12d/(d+2) H^2, independently of the\nstabilization mechanism for the compact space, in addition to the usual KK\nmasses, which instead encode the effects of the stabilization. General\narguments, as well as specific examples, lead us to conjecture that, for\nsufficiently large dS curvature, the compactified geometry becomes\ngravitationally unstable due to the tachyonic growth of the scalar\nperturbations. This mean that for any stabilization mechanism the curvature of\nthe dS geometry cannot exceed some critical value. We relate this effect to the\nanisotropy of the bulk geometry and suggest the end points of the instability.\nOf relevance for inflationary cosmology, the perturbations of the bulk metric\ninevitably induce a new modulus field, which describes the conformal\nfluctuations of the 4 dimensional metric. If this mode is light during\ninflation, the induced conformal fluctuations will be amplified with a scale\nfree spectrum and with an amplitude which is disentangled from the standard\nresult of slow-roll inflation.

The method replaces C by C_{n} which is the set of pairs,\nR_{n},I_{n}, of n figure rational numbers in some basis.

A method of taking the limit n to infinity to\nobtain locally flat continuum based space and time is outlined. Possibly the\nmost interesting result is that R_{n} based space is invariant under scale\ntransformations which correspond to expansion and contraction of space relative\nto a flat background. Also the location of the origin, which is a space and\ntime singularity, does not change under these transformations.

A\nset of ordered EPR pairs in one of the four Bell states is used. For each pair,\neach of the two legitimate users owns a photon of the entangled pair via\nquantum channel. The pairs are divided into two types of group, i.e., the\nchecking groups and the encoding-decoding groups. In the checking groups,\ntaking advantage of the swapping quantum entanglement and Alice's (the message\nsender's) public announcement, the eavesdropping can be detected provided that\nthe number of the checking groups is big enough. After insuring the security of\nthe quantum channel, Alice encodes her bits via the local unitary operations on\nthe encoding-decoding groups. Then she performs her Bell measurements on her\nphotons and publicly announces her measurement results. After her announcement,\nthe message receiver Bob performs his Bell measurements on his photons and\ndirectly extracts the encoding bits by using the property of the quantum\nentanglement swapping. The security of the present scheme is also discussed:\nunder the attack scenarios to our best knowledge, the scheme is secure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2004 12:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
