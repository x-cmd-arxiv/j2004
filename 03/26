Secondly, we examine the screened phonons and the\ninteraction mediated by phonons. In a consistent picture, we derive an\nexpression of the effective interaction which includes (1) the screened Coulomb\ninteractions, (2) the pairing interactions mediated by phonons, and (3) the\neffective interactions mediated by spin and charge fluctuations.

The local aspects of the EP include noncovariance of the\nenergy-momentum pseudotensor (EMPT) of the gravitational field, non-uniqueness\nof the EMPT, asymmetry of EMPT, and vanishing metric energy-momentum tensor.\nThe global aspect of the EP relates to the lack of integral conservation laws\ndue to the general difficulties in defining invariant integrals of tensors in\nnon-Euclidean space. These difficulties are related to the lack of precise\ndefinition of a reference frame in the GR. A reference frame is defined here as\na differential manifold with an affine connection. The resulting unique\ndecomposition of the Levi-Civita connection into its affine and nonmetric parts\nallows for a covariant definition of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor.\nIt is pointed out that the invariance of the Lagrangian (or action functional)\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure the covariance of the\nLagrange-Euler field theory.

Roughly speaking, the new duality functor takes a\nspectrum to the cofiltered diagram of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of its finite\nsubcomplexes. In the other direction, the duality functor takes a cofiltered\ndiagram of spectra to the filtered colimit of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of\nthe spectra in the diagram. We prove the equivalence of homotopy theories by\nshowing that both are equivalent to the category of ind-spectra (filtered\ndiagrams of spectra).\n  To construct our new homotopy theories, we prove a general existence theorem\nfor colocalization model structures generalizing known results for cofibrantly\ngenerated model categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2004 21:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 10:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

The theory is complemented by a\ndescription of a numerical procedure for solving the mean-field equations\nquantitatively. With our treatment, we can determine self-consistently both the\nfiring rates and the firing correlations, without being restricted to specific\nneuron models. Here, we solve the analytically derived mean-field equations\nnumerically for integrate-and-fire neurons. Several known key properties of\norientation selective cortical neurons emerge naturally from the description:\nIrregular firing with statistics close to -- but not restricted to -- Poisson\nstatistics; an almost linear gain function (firing frequency as a function of\nstimulus contrast) of the neurons within the network; and a contrast-invariant\ntuning width of the neuronal firing. We find that the irregularity in firing\ndepends sensitively on synaptic strengths. If Fano factors are bigger than 1,\nthen they are so for all stimulus orientations that elicit firing. We also find\nthat the tuning of the noise in the input current is the same as the tuning of\nthe external input, while that for the mean input current depends on both the\nexternal input and the intracortical connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2004 19:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Even the ground state of a pair of identical oscillators exhibits\neffects on the quantum nature of one oscillator, e.g., a diminution of position\nuncertainty, and an increase in momentum uncertainty and uncertainty product,\nfrom their unperturbed values. Interaction between quantum and classical\noscillators is simulated by constructing a quantum state with one oscillator\ninitially in its ground state, the other in a coherent or Glauber state. The\nsubsequent wave function for this state is calculated exactly, both for\nidentical and distinct oscillators. The reduced probability distribution for\nthe quantum oscillator, and its position and momentum expectation values and\nuncertainties, are obtained from this wave function. The oscillator acquires an\noscillation amplitude corresponding to a beating between the normal modes of\nthe system; the behavior of the position and momentum uncertainties can become\nquite complicated.
