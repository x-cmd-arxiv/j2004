In particular the experimentally observed strong\nrenormalization of the in-plane oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) which\nappear upon doping in the HTSC's is discussed. It is shown that the\ncharacteristic softening, indicating a strong EPI, is most likely a generic\neffect of the CuO plane and is driven by a nonlocal coupling of the displaced\nions to the localized charge-fluctuations (CF's) at the Cu and O ions. The\ndifferent behaviour of the OBSM during the insulator-metal transition via the\nunderdoped phase is calculated and from a comparison of these modes conclusions\nabout the electronic state in the HTSC's are drawn. The underdoped state is\nmodelled in terms of a charge response which is insulator-like at the Cu and is\ncompeting with a metallic charge response at the O-network in the CuO plane.\nFor the non-cuprate HTSC Ba-Bi-O also a strong renormalization of the OBSM is\npredicted. C-axis polarized infrared and Raman-active modes of the HTSC's are\ncalculated in terms of CF's and anisotropic dipole-fluctuations and the problem\nof a metallic character of the BiO planes is studied.Interlayer phonons and\ntheir accompanying charge response are investigated.
