Since the majority of these sources are\nlikely to be z~6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the F775W i'-band and\nF850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-alpha absorption, the number of detected\ncandidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formation\nrate at this redshift. We demonstrate that the increased depth of UDF enables\nus to reach an 8-sigma limiting magnitude of z'(AB)=28.5 (equivalent to\n1.5/h{70}^2 M_sun/yr at z=6, or 0.1 L*(UV) for the z~3 U-drop population),\npermitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved form\nof the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) at\nz'(AB)<28.5 with (i'-z')>1.3 over the deepest 11arcmin^2 portion of the UDF\nfield. The characteristic luminosity (L*) is consistent with values observed at\nz~3. The faint end slope (alpha) is less well constrained, but is consistent\nwith only modest evolution. The main change appears to be in the number density\n(Phi*). Specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool stars\nand lower redshift sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the\nstar formation rate at z~6 was at least x6 LESS than at z~3 (Stanway, Bunker &\nMcMahon 2003). This declining comoving star formation rate (0.005\nh{70}M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 at z~6 for a Salpeter IMF) poses an interesting challenge\nfor models which suggest that L>0.1L* star forming galaxies at z~6 reionized\nthe universe.

We observe a clear large\nN scaling for the 1- and 2-point function of Wilson loops, as well as the\n2-point function of Polyakov lines. The 2-point functions agree with a\nuniversal wave function renormalization. The large N double scaling limit\ncorresponds to the continuum limit of non-commutative gauge theory, so the\nobserved large N scaling demonstrates the non-perturbative renormalizability of\nthis non-commutative field theory. The area law for the Wilson loops holds at\nsmall physical area as in commutative 2d planar gauge theory, but at large\nareas we find an oscillating behavior instead. In that regime the phase of the\nWilson loop grows linearly with the area. This agrees with the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect in the presence of a constant magnetic field, identified with the\ninverse non-commutativity parameter. Next we investigate the 3d \\lambda \\phi^4\nmodel with two non-commutative coordinates and explore its phase diagram. Our\nresults agree with a conjecture by Gubser and Sondhi in d=4, who predicted that\nthe ordered regime splits into a uniform phase and a phase dominated by stripe\npatterns. We further present results for the correlators and the dispersion\nrelation. In non-commutative field theory the Lorentz invariance is explicitly\nbroken, which leads to a deformation of the dispersion relation. In one loop\nperturbation theory this deformation involves an additional infrared divergent\nterm. Our data agree with this perturbative result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2004 16:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper we show that this agreement extends to the next order and\ndevelop a systematic procedure to compute higher orders in such large angular\nmomentum expansion.

Set theory has been for a long time the most popular\nfoundation. However, it was not been able to win completely over its rivals:\nlogic, the theory of algorithms, and theory of categories. Moreover, practical\napplications of mathematics and its inner problems caused creation of different\ngeneralization of sets: multisets, fuzzy sets, rough sets etc. Thus, we\nencounter a problem: Is it possible to find the most fundamental structure in\nmathematics? The situation is similar to the quest of physics for the most\nfundamental \"brick\" of nature and for a grand unified theory of nature.

The\ndecay time constant of the preamplifier is 80 ns and its gain is approximately\n0.8 V/pC. The output from the preamplifier is received by a shaper\n(main-amplifier) with a gain of 7. A baseline restoration circuit is\nincorporated in the main-amplifier, and the current used for the baseline\nrestoration is 5-times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD. The threshold voltage\nfor the discriminator section is common to the 4 channels and their digital\noutput level is LVDS-compatible. The ASD IC also has an analog output of the\npreamplifier. The equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pF is\naround 2000 electrons. The power dissipation with LVDS outputs (100 $\\Omega$\nload) is 57 mW/ch.

Femtosecond optical pulse interacts with the electron beam in the\ntwo-period undulator resonant to 800 nm wavelength and produces energy\nmodulation within a slice of the electron bunch. Following the energy modulator\nthe electron beam enters the first part of the baseline gap-adjustable X-ray\nundulator and produces SASE radiation with 100 MW-level power. Due to energy\nmodulation the frequency is correlated to the longitudinal position within the\nfew-cycle-driven slice of the SASE radiation pulse. The largest frequency\noffset corresponds to a single-spike pulse in the time domain which is confined\nto one half-oscillation period near the central peak electron energy. After the\nfirst undulator the electron beam is guided through a magnetic delay which we\nuse to position the X-ray spike with the largest frequency offset at the\n\"fresh\" part of the electron bunch. After the chicane the electron beam and the\nradiation produced in the first undulator enter the second undulator which is\nresonant with the offset frequency. In the second undulator the seed radiation\nat reference frequency plays no role, and only a single (300 as duration) spike\ngrows rapidly. The final part of the undulator is a tapered section allowing to\nachieve maximum output power 100-150 GW in 0.15 nm wavelength range. Attosecond\nX-ray pulse is naturally synchronized with its fs optical pulse which reveals\nunique perspective for pump-probe experiments with sub-femtosecond resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2004 12:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We model the\nquantum full adder as a realistic complex algorithm on a large number of qubits\nin an Ising-spin quantum computer. Our results are an important step toward\neffective modeling of the quantum modular adder which is needed for Shor's and\nother quantum algorithms. Our full adder has the following features: (i) The\nnear-resonant transitions with small detunings are completely suppressed, which\nallows us to decrease errors by several orders of magnitude and to model a\n1000-qubit full adder. (We add a 1000-bit number using 2001 spins.) (ii) We\nconstruct the full adder gates directly as sequences of radio-frequency pulses,\nrather than breaking them down into generalized logical gates, such as\nControl-Not and one qubit gates. This substantially reduces the number of\npulses needed to implement the full adder. [The maximum number of pulses\nrequired to add one bit (F-gate) is 15]. (iii) Full adder is realized in a\nhomogeneous spin chain. (iv) The phase error is minimized: the F-gates generate\napproximately the same phase for different states of the superposition.
