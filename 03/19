Assuming an\ninactive disk, a hot corona should form above the disk since there is a\ncontinuous supply of hot gas from stellar winds of the close-by massive stars.\nWhether the cool disk can survive depends on the mass exchange between the disk\nand corona. If the disk-corona interaction is dominated by evaporation and the\nrate is larger than the Bondi accretion rate in the Galactic Center, the disk\nwill be depleted within a certain time period and no persistent disk will\nexist. On the other hand, if the interaction results in hot gas steadily\ncondensing into the disk, an inactive cool disk might survive.

The HI has\nbeen traced out to a radius R~8R_25 or 48 disc scale-lengths, making it one of\nthe largest HI extents reported (800\" or 12.6kpc at the assumed distance of\n3.3Mpc). Approximately 75% of the HI resides in a doughnut which is seen close\nto face-on and the optical galaxy fits snugly within the hole of the doughnut.\nThe remaining 25% of the neutral gas is found in an annulus concentric with the\ndoughnut and with a somewhat larger ellipticity. A total HI mass of 1.52 x 10^8\nMsol is found, which implies an M(HI)/L_B = 0.22 in solar units.

The strength of this\nsignature is dependent on the source spectrum and flux impinging on the disk\nsurface, and is thus very sensitive to the system geometry. The general\nweakness of this feature in the hard state has been attributed to either a\ntruncation of the thin disk, large ionization, or beaming of the corona region\naway from the disk with \\beta~0.3. This latter velocity is comparable to jet\nnozzle velocities, so we explore whether a jet can account for the observed\nreflection fractions. It has been suggested that jets may contribute to the\nhigh-energy spectra of X-ray binaries, via either synchrotron from around\n100-1000 r_g along the jet axis or from inverse Compton (synchrotron\nself-Compton and/or external Compton) from near the base.

Stellar birth is thus intimately\nlinked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which determines when\nand where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via\naccretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. Slow,\ninefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support,\nwhereas fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence.\n  The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary can be\nexplained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. The dynamical\nevolution of nascent star clusters is very complex. This strongly influences\nthe stellar mass spectrum. The equation of state (EOS) plays a pivotal role in\nthe fragmentation process.

The\nexperiments and simulations are performed within an annulus to impose periodic\nboundary conditions. Rods tilted with respect to the vertical are observed to\nspontaneously develop a horizontal velocity depending on the acceleration of\nthe plate. For high plate acceleration, the rods are observed to always move in\nthe direction of tilt. However, the rods are also observed to move opposite to\ndirection of tilt for a small range of plate acceleration and rod tilt. A phase\ndiagram of the observed motion is presented as a function of plate acceleration\nand the tilt of the rods which is varied by changing the number of rods inside\nthe annulus. Next we introduce a novel molecular dynamics method to simulate\nthe dynamics of the rods using the dimensions and dissipation parameters from\nthe experiments. We reproduce the observed horizontal rod speeds as a function\nof rod tilt and plate acceleration in the simulations. By decreasing the\nfriction between the rods and the base plate to zero in the simulation, we\nidentify the friction during the collision as the crucial ingredient for\noccurrence of the horizontal motion.

Good agreement for\nthe horizontal velocity as a function of rod tilt and plate acceleration is\nfound between experiments, simulations and theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2004 00:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Using an\nappropriate representation and averaging approximations we show that resonant\nionisation is controlled by a separatrix, and provide necessary conditions for\na dynamical resonance to affect the ionisation probability.\n  The position of the dynamical resonance is computed using a high-order\nperturbation series, and estimate its radius of convergence. We show that the\nposition of the dynamical resonance does not coincide precisely with the\nionisation maxima, and that the field switch-on time can dramatically affect\nthe ionisation signal which, for long switch times, reflects the shape of an\nincipient homoclinic. Similarly, the resonance ionisation time can reflect the\ntime-scale of the separatrix motion, which is therefore longer than\nconventional static field Stark ionisation. We explain why these effects should\nbe observed in the quantum dynamics.\n  PACs: 32.80.Rm, 33.40.+f, 34.10.+x, 05.45.Ac, 05.45.Mt\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2004 12:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
