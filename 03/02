The use of a line-by-line differential analysis technique\nbetween the components of each pair allows to reach errors of about 0.02 dex in\nthe iron content difference. Most of the pairs have abundance differences lower\nthan 0.02 dex and there are no pairs with differences larger than 0.07 dex. The\nfour cases of differences larger than 0.02 dex may be spouriuos because of the\nlarger error bars affecting pairs with large temperature difference, cold stars\nand rotating stars. The pair HD 219542, previously reported by us to have\ndifferent composition, results instead normal. For non-rotating stars warmer\nthan 5500 K, we are able to exclude in most cases the ingestion of more than 1\nEarth Mass of iron (about 5 Earth masses of meteoritic material) during the\nmain sequence lifetime of the stars, placing more stringent limits (about 0.4\nEarth masses of iron) in five cases of warm stars. This latter limit is similar\nto the estimates of rocky material accreted by the Sun during its main sequence\nlifetime. Combining the results of the present analysis with those for the\nHyades and Pleiades, we conclude that the hypothesis that pollution by\nplanetary material is the only responsible for the highest metallicity of the\nstars with planets may be rejected at more than 99% level of confidence if the\nincidence of planets in these samples is as high as 8% and similar to the field\nstars included in current radial velocity surveys. However, the significance of\nthis result drops considerably if the incidence of planets around stars in\nbinary systems and clusters is less than a half than around normal field stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2004 08:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 15:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

First, we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US\nstocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for\nsplitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow. Our\nnew analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a\nsquare-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to\nthe claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller\nexponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller\nsize trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law\nexponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and\nsolely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do\nnot have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange. We perform new\nempirical analysis on transaction data for the 262 largest stocks listed in the\nLondon Stock Exchange, and find that the distribution of volume decays as a\npower-law with an exponent $\\approx 3/2$ -- in sharp contrast to FL's claim\nthat the distribution of transaction volume does not have a power-law tail.

In the first part, we propose a resummation technique applicable to the\nRegge limit. We develop a new systematic procedure for this limit in\nperturbative QCD to arbitrary logarithmic order. The formalism relies on the IR\nstructure and the gauge symmetry of the theory. Using a factorization procedure\nintroduced by Sen, we derive a sum of convolutions in transverse momentum space\nover soft and jet functions, which approximate the amplitude up to\npower-suppressed corrections. A set of evolution equations generalizing the\nBFKL equation and controlling the high energy behavior of the amplitudes to\narbitrary logarithmic accuracy is derived. The general method is illustrated in\nthe case of leading and next-to-leading logarithmic gluon reggeization and BFKL\nequation. We confirm the standard results at LL accuracy. At NLL order, we find\nan agreement with the reggeization conjecture up to two loops. However,\nstarting at three loop order, we identify contributions violating the Regge\nansatz. In addition, we calculate the evolution kernel determining the\nhigh-energy behavior of the non-reggeized term in the scattering amplitude. In\nthe second part, we focus our attention to another intriguing problem of\nhigh-energy QCD, the resummation associated with soft radiation in dijet events\nwhich is complicated by the presence of non-global logarithms. We introduce a\nset of correlations between energy flow and event shapes that are sensitive to\nthe flow of color at short distances in jet events.

The balancing of its two non-perturbative effects, open membrane\ninstantons against gaugino condensation on the hidden boundary, which act with\nopposing forces on the interval length, is used to stabilize the orbifold\nmodulus (dilaton) and other moduli. The non-perturbative effects break\nsupersymmetry spontaneously through F-terms which leads to a positive vacuum\nenergy density. In contrast to the situation for the weakly coupled heterotic\nstring, the charged scalar matter fields receive non-vanishing vacuum\nexpectation values and therefore masses in a phenomenologically relevant\nregime. It is important that in order to obtain these de Sitter vacua we are\nnot relying on exotic effects or fine-tuning of parameters.

In this note, we show that when the\nAlexander polynomial becomes inconclusive, the notion of \"knot adjacency\",\nstudied in the paper \"Knot adjacency, genus and essential tori\" by the authors,\ncan be used to obtain obstructions to fibering of knots and of 3-manifolds. As\nan application, given a fibered knot K', we construct infinitely many\nnon-fibered knots that share the same Alexander module and the same Vassiliev\ninvariants up to certain orders with K'. Our construction also provides, for\nevery natural number n, examples of irreducible 3-manifolds that cannot be\ndistinguished by the Cochran-Melvin finite type invariants of order < n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2004 20:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2004 17:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 07:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2004 17:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 04:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 16:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2006 19:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-23"}

For us $\\fc$ is\nusually a ``general'' complete intersection and we usually require that $A$ be\nlevel. The precise value of the Hilbert function of a relatively compressed\nalgebra is open, and we show that finding this value is equivalent to the\nFr\\\"oberg Conjecture. We then turn to the minimal free resolution of a level\nalgebra relatively compressed with respect to a general complete intersection.\nWhen the algebra is Gorenstein of even socle degree we give the precise\nresolution. When it is of odd socle degree we give good bounds on the graded\nBetti numbers. We also relate this case to the Minimal Resolution Conjecture of\nMustata for points on a projective variety. Finding the graded Betti numbers is\nessentially equivalent to determining to what extent there can be redundant\nsummands (i.e. ``ghost terms'') in the minimal free resolution, i.e. when\ncopies of the same $R(-t)$ can occur in two consecutive free modules. This is\neasy to arrange using Koszul syzygies; we show that it can also occur in more\nsurprising situations that are not Koszul. Using the equivalence to the\nFr\\\"oberg Conjecture, we show that in a polynomial ring where that conjecture\nholds (e.g. in three variables), the possible non-Koszul ghost terms are\nextremely limited. Finally, we use the connection to the Fr\\\"oberg Conjecture,\nas well as the calculation of the minimal free resolution for relatively\ncompressed Gorenstein algebras, to find the minimal free resolution of general\nArtinian almost complete intersections in many new cases.
