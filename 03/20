This result is general, it\ncan be applied to all antenna systems and is valid for all schemes to detect\npolarization, like correlation and differential polarimeters. The axisymmetric\ncase is attractive: it generates an $E$-mode--like $\\Pi$ pattern, the\ncontamination does not depend on the scanning strategy and the instrumental\npolarization map does not have $B$-mode contamination, making axisymmetric\nsystems suitable to detect the faint $B$-mode signal of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground Polarization. The $E$-mode of the contamination only affects the\nFWHM scales leaving the larger ones significantly cleaner. Our analysis is also\napplied to the SPOrt experiment where we find that the contamination of the\n$E$-mode is negligible in the $\\ell$-range of interest for CMBP large angular\nscale investigations (multipole $\\ell < 10$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2004 15:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The zero temperature\ndependence of the neutron and proton spin polarization parameters as functions\nof density is found for SkM$^*$, SGII (symmetric case) and SLy4, SLy5 (strongly\nasymmetric case) effective forces. By comparing free energy densities, it is\nshown that in symmetric nuclear matter ferromagnetic spin state (parallel\norientation of neutron and proton spins) is more preferable than\nantiferromagnetic one (antiparallel orientation of spins). Strongly asymmetric\nnuclear matter undergoes at some critical density a phase transition to the\nstate with the oppositely directed spins of neutrons and protons while the\nstate with the same direction of spins does not appear. In comparison with\nneutron matter, even small admixture of protons strongly decreases the\nthreshold density of spin instability. It is clarified that protons become\ntotally polarized within a very narrow density domain while the density profile\nof the neutron spin polarization parameter is characterized by the appearance\nof long tails near the transition density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2004 05:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-14"}
