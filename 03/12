The variation can be discussed in terms\nof the particle injection from the pulsar in two different directions: the\nequatorial plane containing the torus and the symmetry axis along the jet. In\nthe equatorial plane, spectra within the torus are the hardest, with photon\nindex $\\alpha \\approx 1.9$, and are almost independent of the surface\nbrightness.

In addition to the P Cygni and\nemission lines, two shortward shifted absorption systems are present. Evidence\nis given that these absorptions originate in two separate expanding shells,\noutside the wind layers where the emission lines are formed. The outer main\nshell, containing most of the matter ejected at outburst, produces the\nso-called ``principal absorption line system'', and the inner faster moving\nsecond shell produces the so-called ``diffuse--enhanced absorption line\nsystem''. The outflow velocity of the two shells increases exponentially with\ntime reaching a value of about 1750 km/s and 2900 km/s, respectively. We\nsuggest that the acceleration of the shells is the result of increasing\nline-radiation pressure due to the UV-brightening of the star as the effective\nradius decreases. Around day 60 the second shell has overtaken the slower\nmoving principal system shell, and merged with it. This explains: the sudden\ndisappearance of the diffuse line system near that date, the upward jump of 240\nkm/s in velocity of the principal system and the first detection of hard X-ray\nemission on day 63. This velocity jump indicates that the main shell is about 4\ntimes more massive than the second shell.

A model for the irradiation geometry that takes into\naccount surface elements near the terminator of the donor star indicates that\npossibly also low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) can undergo mass transfer cycles.\nRegarding the braking rate, which is necessary to drive cycles, basically the\nsame restrictions apply for short period LMXBs as they do for short period CVs.\nWe confirm that LMXBs containing giants can undergo cyles.
