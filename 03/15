We will show that the presence of nodal lines can account for observed\n180 degree phase jumps in drifting subpulses and their otherwise poor phase\nstability, even if the time-like oscillations are strictly periodic. Our model\ncan also account for the \"mode changes\" and \"nulls\" observed in some pulsars as\nquasiperiodic changes between pulsation modes of different l or radial overtone\nn, analogous to pulsation mode changes observed in oscillating white dwarf\nstars. We will discuss other definitive and testable requirements of our model\nand show that they are qualitatively supported by existing data. While\nreserving judgment until the completion of quantitative tests, we are inspired\nenough by the existing observational support for our model to speculate about\nthe excitation mechanism of the non-radial pulsations, the physics we can learn\nfrom them, and their relationship to the period evolution of pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 13:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The materials investigated are\nY$_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ (pyrochlore system), SrCr$_{8.6}$Ga$_{3.4}$O$_{19}$ (piled\npairs of Kagom\\'e layers) and (H$_3$O)Fe$_3$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ (jarosite\ncompound). Despite a very small amount of disorder, all the samples exhibit\nmany characteristic features of spin glass dynamics below a freezing\ntemperature $T_g$, much smaller than their Curie-Weiss temperature $\\theta$.\nThe ageing properties of their thermoremanent magnetization can be well\naccounted for by the same scaling law as in spin glasses, and the values of the\nscaling exponents are very close. The effects of temperature variations during\nageing have been specifically investigated. In the pyrochlore and the\nbi-Kagom\\'e compounds, a decrease of temperature after some waiting period at a\ncertain temperature $T_p$ re-initializes ageing and the evolution at the new\ntemperature is the same as if the system were just quenched from above $T_g$.\nHowever, as the temperature is raised back to $T_p$, the sample recovers the\nstate it had previously reached at that temperature. These features are known\nin spin glasses as rejuvenation and memory effects. They are clear signatures\nof the spin glass dynamics. In the Kagom\\'e compound, there is also some\nrejuvenation and memory, but much larger temperature changes are needed to\nobserve the effects. In that sense, the behaviour of this compound is\nquantitatively different from that of spin glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 09:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To find $\\Sigma(p)$ we propose\na new (differential) form of the Dyson-Schwinger Equation (DSE) for\n$\\Sigma(p)$, based on an infinitesimal $subtractive$ Renormalization via a\ndifferential operator which $lowers$ the degree of divergence in integration on\nthe RHS, by $TWO$ units. This warrants $\\Sigma(p-k)\\approx \\Sigma(p)$ in the\nintegrand since its $k$-dependence is no longer sensitive to the principal term\n$(p-k)^2$ in the quark propagator. The simplified DSE (which incorporates WT\nidentity in the Landau gauge) is satisfied for large $p^2$ by $\\Sigma(p)$ =\n$\\Sigma(0)/(1 + \\beta p^2)$, except for Log factors. The limit $p^2 =0$\ndetermines $\\Sigma_0$.A third limit $p^2 = -m_0^2$ defines the $dynamical$ mass\n$m_0$ via $\\Sigma(im_0) = + m_0$.

The confined monopoles -- string\njunctions of the microscopic theory -- are mapped onto BPS kinks of the CP(1)\nmodel. The string junction is 1/4 BPS. Masses and other characteristics of the\nconfined monopoles are matched with those of the CP(1)-model kinks. The\nmatching demonstrates the occurrence of an anomaly in the monopole central\ncharge in 4D Yang-Mills theory. We study what becomes of the confined monopole\nin the bona fide non-Abelian limit of degenerate mass terms where a global\nSU(2) symmetry is restored.

The historical trends for\nSwitzerland (1876-2002) implies that there may be a fundamental limiting force\nto restrict the increase of the effectiveness. As a result, it seems that the\ndensity function is essential to define and understand the mortality dynamics,\nthe maximum longevity, the effectiveness for longevity, the paradigm of\nrectangularization and the historical trends of the effectiveness by the\ncomplementarity between the survival and mortality functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 10:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One hallmark of cancerous\ngenomes is genomic instability, with mutation rates far greater than those of\nnormal cells. In microsatellite instability (MIN tumors), these are often\ncaused by damage to mismatch repair genes, allowing further mutation of the\ngenome and tumor progression. These mutation rates may lie near the error\ncatastrophe found in the quasispecies model of adaptive RNA genomes, suggesting\nthat further increasing mutation rates will destroy cancerous genomes. However,\nrecent results have demonstrated that DNA genomes exhibit an error threshold at\nmutation rates far lower than their conservative counterparts. Furthermore,\nwhile the maximum viable mutation rate in conservative systems increases\nindefinitely with increasing master sequence fitness, the semiconservative\nthreshold plateaus at a relatively low value. This implies a paradox, wherein\ninaccessible mutation rates are found in viable tumor cells. In this paper, we\naddress this paradox, demonstrating an isomorphism between the conservatively\nreplicating (RNA) quasispecies model and the semiconservative (DNA) model with\npost-methylation DNA repair mechanisms impaired. Thus, as DNA repair becomes\ninactivated, the maximum viable mutation rate increases smoothly to that of a\nconservatively replicating system on a transformed landscape, with an upper\nbound that is dependent on replication rates. We postulate that inactivation of\npost-methylation repair mechanisms are fundamental to the progression of a\ntumor cell and hence these mechanisms act as a method for prevention and\ndestruction of cancerous genomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2004 14:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 15:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
