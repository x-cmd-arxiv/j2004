The energy flux of the waves declines more steeply with radius\nthan the inverse-square law predicted by energy conservation, implying that\ndissipation plays an important role in tapping the wave energy. We show that\nsuch dispersing sound waves/weak shocks are detectable as ripples on\nunsharp-masked X-ray cluster maps, and point out that the interfaces between\nthe intracluster medium and old bubbles are also clearly detectable in\nunsharp-masked X-ray maps.

With this smaller gas temperature and the observed\ndistribution of galaxies and gas, the energy reservoir in galactic motions is\nsufficient to sustain the required heating rate for the lifetime of the\ncluster. The galaxies also lose a smaller amount of energy through dynamical\nfriction to the dark matter implying that non--cooling-flow clusters should\nhave flat-cored dark-matter density distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2004 21:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We describe\npulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) sequences that can be used to\nmeasure precisely even small systematic errors in rotations of\nelectron-spin-based qubits. Using these sequences we obtain values for errors\nin rotation angle and axis for single-qubit rotations using a commercial EPR\nspectrometer. We conclude that errors in qubit operations by pulsed EPR are not\nlimiting factors in the implementation of electron-spin based quantum\ncomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2004 20:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2004 11:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 09:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
