The study is based on a sample of 30 sources distributed\nalong the IRAS colour-colour diagram. The sources were chosen to trace the\nMiras with thick shells and the whole range of OH/IR stars. The Miras exhibit a\n1665 MHz emission strength comparable to that at 1667 MHz. Even though the\nMiras of the study have quite thick shells, their spectral characteristics in\nboth main lines attest to a strong heterogeneity in their OH shell with, in\nparticular, the presence of significant turbulence and acceleration. The\nexpansion velocity has been found to be about the same at 1665 and 1667 MHz,\ntaking into account a possible velocity turbulence of 1-2km/s at the location\nof the main-line maser emission. An increase in the intensity ratio 1667/1665\nwith shell thickness has been found. A plausible explanation for such a\nphenomenon is that competitive gain in favour of the 1667 MHz line increases\nwhen the shell is getting thicker. There is an evolution in the spectral\nprofile shape with the appearance of a substantial inter-peak signal when the\nshell is getting thicker. Also, inter-peak components are found and can be as\nstrong as the external standard peaks when the shell is very thick. This trend\nfor an increase of the signal in between the two main peaks is thought to be\nthe result of an increase of the saturation with shell thickness. All sources\nbut two - a Mira and an OH/IR star from the lower part of the colour-colour\ndiagram - are weakly polarized. The strong polarization observed for those two\nparticular objects is thought to be the result of perturbations in their\nshells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2004 16:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The dynamics of the\nelectronic population and nuclear coherence is analyzed by solving the chain of\ncoupled differential equations for %mean coordinate, population inversion,\nelectron-vibrational correlation, etc. [Prezhdo, Pereverzev, J. Chem. Phys.\n{113} 6557 (2000)]. Intriguing results are obtained in the approximation of a\nsmall change of the nuclear equilibrium upon photoexcitation. In the limiting\ncase of resonance between the electronic energy gap and the frequency of the\nnuclear mode these results are justified by comparison to the exactly solvable\nJaynes-Cummings model. It is found that the photoinduced processes in the model\ndimer are arranged according to their time scales: (i) fast scale of nuclear\nmotion, (ii) intermediate scale of dynamical redistribution of electronic\npopulation between excited states as well as growth and dynamics of\nelectron-nuclear correlation, (iii) slow scale of electronic population\napproach to the quasi-equilibrium distribution, decay of electron-nuclear\ncorrelation, and decrease of the amplitude of mean coordinate oscillation. The\nlatter processes are accompanied by a noticeable growth of the nuclear\ncoordinate dispersion associated with the overall nuclear wavepacket width. The\ndemonstrated quantum relaxation features of the photoinduced vibronic dynamics\nin molecular dimers are obtained by a simple method, applicable to systems with\nmany degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2004 04:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We show that\nthe probe light shift leads to nonlinearity in the spin dynamics and limits the\nuseful Faraday measurement window. Removing the nonlinearity allows a\nnon-perturbing measurement on the much longer timescale set by decoherence. The\nnonlinear spin Hamiltonian is of interest for studies of quantum chaos and\nreal-time quantum state estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2004 20:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2004 22:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is found that\nthe evolution path of the entangled state in the SO(3) sphere breaks an odd or\neven number of times, corresponding to the double connectedness of the SO(3)\ngroup. An odd number of breaks leads to an additional $\\pi$ phase to the\nentangled state, but an even number of breaks does not.
