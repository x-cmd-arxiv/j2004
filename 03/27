The WC7\n+ O4-5 spectroscopic binary WR 140 is the prototype of colliding-wind, episodic\ndust-making Wolf-Rayet systems which also show strong variations in radio and\nX-ray emission. The JHK spectra showed changes in continuum and in the\nequivalent widths of the WC emission lines, consistent with formation of dust\nstarting between 2001 January 3 and March 26 (orbital phases 0.989 and 0.017)\nand its subsequent fading and cooling. The 1.083-micron He I line has a P-Cygni\nprofile which showed variations in both absorption and emission components as\nWR 140 went through periastron passage. The variation of the absorption\ncomponent yielded tight constraints on the geometry of the wind-collision\nregion, giving theta = 50 +/- 8 degrees for the opening semi-angle of the\ninteraction `cone', indicating a wind-momentum ratio of the O to the WR\nstar=0.1, about three times larger than previously believed. As the system\napproached periastron, the emission component showed the appearance of a\nsignificant sub-peak, movement of which across the profile was seen to be\nconsistent with its formation in wind material flowing along the contact\ndiscontinuity between the two stellar winds and the changing orientation of the\ncolliding wind region. The flux carried in the sub-peak exceeded the X-ray\nfluxes measured at previous periastron passages. This additional source of\nradiative cooling of the shock-heated gas probably causes it to depart from\nbeing adiabatic around periastron passage, thereby accounting for the departure\nof the X-ray flux from its previously expected $1/d$-dependency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2004 08:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
