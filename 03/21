We investigate closely the flux profile during the burst expansion\nstage. Applying a semi-analytical model we are able to uncover the behavior of\na photospheric radius and to simulate the evolution of neutron star\n(NS)-accretion disk system. The bottom flux L_{bot} is a few times the\nEddington limit L_{Edd} for outer layers, because the electron cross-section is\na few times less than the Thomson cross-section at such a high temperatures.\nThe surplus of energy flux with respect to the Eddington, $L_{bot}-L_{Edd}$,\ngoes into the potential energy of the expanded envelope. As cooling of the\nburning zone starts the surplus decreases and thus the envelope shrinks while\nthe emergent photon flux stays the same $L=L_{Edd}$. At a certain moment the NS\nlow-hemisphere, previously screened by the disk, becomes visible to the\nobserver. Consequently, the flux detected by the observer increases. Indeed, we\nobserve to the paradoxical situation when the burning zone cools, but the\napparent flux increases because of the NS-accretion disk geometry. We\ndemonstrate a strong observational evidence of NS-accretion disk occultation in\nthe behavior of the observed bolometric flux. We estimate the anisotropy due to\ngeometry and find that the system should have a high inclination angle.\nFinally, we apply an analytical model of X-ray spectral formation in the\nneutron star atmosphere during burst decay stage to infer the neutron star (NS)\nmass-radius relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2004 22:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
