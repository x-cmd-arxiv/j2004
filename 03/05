Our series of controlled numerical experiments\nindicates that the number and mass density of subhalos can be high enough to\ncause the collisionless dark matter particles in the inner part of a main halo\nto diffuse, flattening the main halo's inner cusp within a few dynamical times.\nDepending on the masses and concentration of the subhalos, the inner density\nprofile of the whole system (main plus sub halos) can either steepen or\nflatten. Subhalo accretion can therefore introduce significant scatter in the\ninner density profiles of dark matter halos, offering a possible explanation\nfor the range of profiles seen in both observations and cosmological\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2004 19:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2004 18:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The near-infrared survey covers an area of ~ 24 sq.\narcmin with 10 sigma limiting magnitudes of ~ 19.0, 18.1, and 17.3 in J, H, and\nKs-band, respectively. We construct JHK color-color and J/J-H and K/H-K\ncolor-magnitude diagrams to identify young stellar objects and estimate their\nmasses. Based on these color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, a rich\npopulation of YSOs is identified which is associated with the W3 Main region. A\nlarge number of previously unreported red sources (H-K > 2) have also been\ndetected around W3 Main. We argue that these red stars are most probably\npre-main sequence stars with intrinsic color excesses. We find that the slope\nof the Ks-band luminosity function of W3 Main is lower than the typical values\nreported for the young embedded clusters. The derived slope of the KLF is the\nsame as that found by Megeath et al. (1996), from which analysis by Megeath et\nal. indicates that the W3 Main region has an age in the range of 0.3--1 Myr.\nBased on the comparison between models of pre-main sequence stars with the\nobserved color-magnitude diagram we find that the stellar population in W3 Main\nis primarily composed of low mass pre-main sequence stars. We also report the\ndetection of isolated young stars with large infrared excesses which are most\nprobably in their earliest evolutionary phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 07:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Rotational modulation is suggested from\nthe similarity between the observed recurrence time-scales (in the range 13-25\ndays) and estimated periods of stellar rotation.

This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides\ndirectly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was\napplied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also\ncalled dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is\nshown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of\ndegree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that\nconics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on\nalgebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained\nwhich constructs the dual image of the curve.

We find that (a) all dimer\nconformations have higher free energies compared to their corresponding\nmonomeric states, and (b) the free energy difference between the Abeta(1-42)\nand the analogous Abeta(1-40) dimer conformation is not significant.

We\nshall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied\nto any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a\nphysical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings\nintroduced to date in a unified fashion.
