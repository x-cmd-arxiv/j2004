We constrain models of the redshift\nevolution of galaxy clustering and find that significant growth of clustering\nhas occurred from z>1 to z=0. A model in which the comoving scale-length, x_0,\nevolves linearly with redshift, x_0(z)=x_0(0)(1-Bz), fits the data better than\nthe 'epsilon' model proposed by Groth and Peebles (1977). The clustering\nproperties depend strongly on observed (R-I) color, with both the reddest and\nbluest galaxies exhibiting large clustering amplitudes and steeper slopes.\nDifferent observed (R-I) color ranges are sensitive to very disparate redshift\nregimes. Red galaxies with (R-I)~1.5 lie in a narrow redshift range centered at\nz~0.85 and have a comoving scale length of clustering at z=0.85 of x_0=5.0\n+/-0.3 Mpc/h. These galaxies have early-type spectra and are likely progenitors\nof massive local ellipticals. The bluest galaxies with (R-I)~0 appear to be a\nmix of star-forming galaxies, both relatively local (z~0.3-0.6) dwarfs and\nbright z>1.4 galaxies, and broad-line AGN. We find that local blue dwarfs are\nrelatively unclustered, with x_0=1.6 +/-0.2 Mpc/h. The z>1.4 blue galaxies have\na larger clustering scale-length, x_0>5 Mpc/h.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2004 21:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2004 18:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2004 20:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We consider axisymmetric\ndipolar fields which are either restricted to the stellar crust, ``crustal\nfields'', or allowed to penetrate the core, ``core fields''. By integrating the\ntwo-dimensional heat transport equation in the crust, taking into account the\nclassical (Larmor) anisotropy of the heat conductivity, we obtain the crustal\ntemperature distribution, assuming an isothermal core. Including quantum\nmagnetic field effects in the envelope as a boundary condition, we deduce the\ncorresponding surface temperature distributions. We find that core fields\nresult in practically isothermal crusts unless the surface field strength is\nwell above $10^{15}$ G while for crustal fields with surface strength above a\nfew times $10^{12}$ G significant deviations from isothermality occur at core\ntemperatures inferior or equal to $10^8$ K. At the stellar surface, the cold\nequatorial region produced by the quantum suppression of heat transport\nperpendicular to the field in the envelope, present for both core and crustal\nfields, is significantly extended by the classical suppression at higher\ndensities in the case of crustal fields. This can result, for crustal fields,\nin two small warm polar regions which will have observational consequences: the\nneutron star has a small effective thermally emitting area and the X-ray pulse\nprofiles are expected to have a distinctively different shape compared to the\ncase of a neutron star with a core field. These features, when compared with\nX-ray data on thermal emission of young cooling neutron stars, will open a way\nto provide observational evidence in favor, or against, the two radically\ndifferent configurations of crustal or core magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2004 10:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The X-ray lightcurve exhibits a\nvariety of features including a significant upward drift over the 60 ks\nobservation. Most notably a series of X-ray dips are apparent with individual\ndips lasting for typically 100-300 s. Some of these dips reach almost 100\npercent diminution of the source flux in the 2.0-4.5 keV band. The EPIC CCD\nspectra can be modelled with two spectral components, a very soft powerlaw\ncontinuum (Gamma ~ 4) dominant below 2 keV, plus a multi-colour disc (MCD)\ncomponent with an inner-disc temperature kT ~ 0.8 keV. The observed upperward\ndrift in the X-ray flux can be attributed to an increase in the level of the\nMCD component, whilst the normalisation of the powerlaw continuum remains\nunchanged. The dipping episodes correspond to a loss of signal from both\nspectral components, although the blocking factor is at least a factor two\nhigher for the MCD component.

By direct integration over\nall possible realizations of the quenched disorder, we obtain the probability\ndistribution of each damage configuration at any level of the imposed external\ndeformation.

This dissipative behavior can be taken into\naccount by using a viscoacoustic propagation model, which incorporates a\ncomplex and frequency-dependent viscoacoustic modulus in the constitutive\nrelation. The main difficulty then lies in finding an efficient way to\ndiscretize the constitutive equation as it becomes a convolution integral in\nthe time domain. To overcome this difficulty the usual approach consists in\napproximating the viscoacoustic modulus by a low-order rational function of\nfrequency. We use here such an approximation and show how it can be\nincorporated in the velocity-pressure formulation for viscoacoustic waves. This\nformulation is coupled with the fictitious domain method which permit us to\nmodel efficiently diffraction by objects of complicated geometry and with the\nPerfectly Matched Layer Model which allows us to model wave propagation in\nunbounded domains. The space discretization of the problem is based on a mixed\nfinite element method and for the discretization in time a 2nd order centered\nfinite difference scheme is employed.

In this work we describe an alternative mechanism inspired by the acoustic\ntime reversal mirror. By solving the inverse time problem in a discrete space\nwe develop a new procedure, the perfect inverse filter. It achieves the exact\ntime reversion in a given region by reinjecting a prescribed wave function at\nits periphery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2004 23:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2004 15:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 11:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}
