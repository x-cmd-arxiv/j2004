In\nthe framework of the so-called Chandrasekhar mass models, the progenitor's\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio has been suggested to be a principal source of peak\nluminosity variations due to a variation in the production of radioactive\n$^{56}$Ni during the explosion. The underlying idea is that an enhanced carbon\nmass fraction should result in a more vigorous explosion since here the energy\nrelease from nuclear reactions is increased.

The X-ray temperature is\nfound to be 11.5{+1.1}{-0.9}keV, the highest X-ray temperature of any cluster\nat z>0.6. In contrast to MS1054-0321, the only other very hot cluster currently\nknown at z>0.8, ClJ1226.9+3332 features a relaxed X-ray morphology, and its\nhigh overall gas temperature is not caused by one or several hot spots. The\nsystem thus constitutes a unique example of a high redshift, high temperature,\nrelaxed cluster, for which the usual hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, and\nthe X-ray mass is most reliable. A temperature profile is constructed (for the\nfirst time at this redshift) and is consistent with the cluster being\nisothermal out to 45% of the virial radius. Within the virial radius\n(corresponding to a measured overdensity of a factor of 200), a total mass of\n(1.4+/-0.5)*10^15 M_solar is derived, with a gas mass fraction of 12+/-5%. The\nbolometric X-ray luminosity is (5.3+/-0.2)*10^45 erg/s. The probabilities of\nfinding a cluster of this mass within the volume of the discovery X-ray survey\nare 8*10^{-5} for Omega_M=1 and 0.64 for Omega_M=0.3, making Omega_M=1 highly\nunlikely. The entropy profile suggests that entropy evolution is being\nobserved. The metal abundance (of Z=0.33{+0.14}{-0.10} Z_solar), gas mass\nfraction, and gas distribution are consistent with those of local clusters;\nthus the bulk of the metals were in place by z=0.89.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2004 13:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A very good agreement was\nfound with the existing literature and new data were added.

DTA measurements have been performed on Bi,Pb(2223) tapes up to 2 kbar\nunder reduced oxygen partial pressure (p(O2) = 0.07 bar). The reaction leading\nto the formation of the 2223 phase was found to occur at higher temperatures\nwhen applying pressure: the reaction DTA peak shifted by 49C at 2 kbar compared\nto the reaction at 1 bar. This temperature shift is due to the higher stability\nof the Pb-rich precursor phases under pressure, as the high isostatic pressure\nprevents Pb from evaporating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2004 13:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In type II see-saw mechanism with dominance of the\nnon-canonical SU(2)_L triplet term, the conventional see-saw term can give a\nsmall contribution to the neutrino mass matrix. If the triplet term corresponds\nto the bimaximal mixing scheme in the normal hierarchy, the small contribution\nof the conventional see-saw term naturally generates non-maximal solar neutrino\nmixing. Atmospheric neutrino mixing is also reduced from maximal, corresponding\nto 1 - \\sin^2 2 \\theta_{23} of order 0.01. Also, small but non-vanishing U_{e3}\nof order 0.001 is obtained. It is also possible that the \\Delta m^2 responsible\nfor solar neutrino oscillations is induced by the small conventional see-saw\nterm.
