Our free\nenergy functional of liquid-crystalline membrane allows for incompressibility\nof the membrane and vanishing of the in-plane shear modulus and obeys\nreflectional and rotational symmetries of the flat bilayer. Interlayer slide at\nthe mid-plane of the membrane results in local difference of surface densities\nof the monolayers. The slide amplitude directly enters free energy via the\nstrain tensor. For small bending deformations the ratio between bending modulus\nand area compression coefficient, Kb/KA, is proportional to the square of\nmonolayer thickness, h. Using the functional we performed self-consistent\ncalculation of steric potential acting on bilayer between parallel confining\nwalls separated by distance 2d. We found that temperature-dependent curvature\nat the minimum of confining potential is enhanced four times for a bilayer with\nslide as compared with a unit bilayer.

Three\nsources of viscous dissipation are considered: water and membrane viscosities\nand interlayer drag. Dispersion has two branches.

Our\nproofs are relatively free of calculations, matrix work and counting, due to\nthe uniqueness viewpoint. We deduce the labeling of coordinates on which\nearlier constructions depend. Extending these ideas, we construct in dimensions\n2^d, for d>>0, the Ypsilanti lattices, which are families of indecomposable\neven unimodular lattices which resemble the Barnes-Wall lattices. The number\nUpsilon (2^d) of isometry types here is large: log_2 (Upsilon (2^d)) has\ndominant term at least (r/4) d 2^{2d}, for any r in [0, 1/2). The Ypsilanti\nlattices may be the first explicitly given families whose sizes are\nasymptotically comparable to the Siegel mass formula estimate (log_2(mass(n))\nhas dominant term (1/4) log_2(n) n^2).

Over short timescales the graph remains fixed\nwhile relative populations of the molecular species change according to a set\nof coupled differential equations. Over long timescales the system is subject\nto periodic perturbations, each of which adds one new node to the graph, with\nrandom links to other nodes, and removes one node with the least relative\npopulation. Starting from a sparse random graph, a small autocatalytic set\n(ACS) inevitably forms and then grows by accreting nodes until it spans the\nentire graph. The resultant fully autocatalytic graph, whose probability of\nforming by pure chance is very small, nevertheless forms in this model in an\naverage time that grows only logarithmically with the size of the system. ACSs\ncan also get destroyed, often accompanied by the sudden extinction of a large\nnumber of species. I show that the largest of the extinction events in this\nmodel are caused by one of three mechanisms, each of which produces a specific\ndiscontinuous change in the graph's topology. The model is analytically\ntractable: two theorems are proved which determine the set of nodes with least\nrelative population in the attractor, for any given graph. This in turn can be\nused to analytically demonstrate the inevitability of the formation and growth\nof ACSs and calculate the associated timescales. Finally, I show that the\nformation and growth of ACSs is robust to the relaxation of many of the\nidealizations made to enhance the analytical tractability of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2004 14:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is\nshown that the effective Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of\npolarized photons with the fiber medium is just the Wang-Keiji type of\nHamiltonian. This, therefore, means that the coiled fiber system may be an\nideal implementation of realizing the nonadiabatic geometric phase gates for\nthe topological quantum computation. The remarkable feature of the present\nmethod is that it can automatically meet the conditions and requirements\nproposed in the Wang-Keiji scheme: (i) in the coiled fiber system, the\ndynamical phase of photon wavefunction caused by the interaction Hamiltonian\nautomatically vanishes; (ii) the Wang-Keiji requirement for the parameters in\nthe Wang-Keiji Hamiltonian can be exactly satisfied automatically in the fiber\nsystem; (iii) the conditional initial state can be easily achieved by\nmanipulating the initial wave vector of polarized photons.
