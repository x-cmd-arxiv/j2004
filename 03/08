It is based on Delaunay tessellation,\nyielding v(f) with a fixed smoothing window over a wide f range, independent of\nthe sampling resolution. It is found that in a gravitationally relaxed halo\nbuilt by hierarchical clustering, v(f) is a robust power law, v(f) f^{-2.5 \\pm\n0.05}, over more than 4 decades in f, from its virial level to the current\nresolution limit. This is valid for halos of different sizes in the LCDM\ncosmology, indicating insensitivity to the initial-fluctuation power spectrum\nas long as the small-scale fluctuations were not completely suppressed. By\nmapping f in position space, we find that the high-f contributions to v(f) come\nfrom the \"cold\" subhalos within the parent halo rather than the halo central\nregion and its global spherical profile. The f in subhalos near the halo virial\nradius is more than 100 times higher than at the halo center, and it decreases\ngradually with decreasing radius. This indicates phase mixing due to mergers\nand tidal effects involving puffing up and heating. The phase-space structure\nprovides a sensitive tool for studying the evolution of subhalos during the\nbuildup of halos. One wishes to understand why the substructure adds up to the\nuniversal power law in v(f). It seems that the f^{-2.5} behavior is related to\nthe hierarchical clustering process and is not a general result of violent\nrelaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2004 19:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This makes it particularly adapted to the search of periods long compared\nto the total observation duration. We propose a semi-analytical approach to\ndetermine the effective number of trial frequencies when searching for unknown\nperiods over a frequency range. This approach can be easily adapted to other\ntests. We show that, using Kuiper's test, we can recover periods in frequency\ndomains where other tests are completely confused by contamination.
