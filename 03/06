LLAGN accretion\ndisks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars\nleft from the previous stronger accretion activity. In principle, these stars\nmay produce several important effects: (i) contribute to the optical/UV spectra\nof some LLAGN; (ii) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks\ncould dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra; (iii) deplete the (accretion) gas\ndisk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole (SMBH);\n(iv) stars, individually or in groups, may slow down and modulate the accretion\nflow significantly due to their inertia. In this way they may produce the LLAGN\ncut-off disks; (v) alternatively, frequent enough stellar collisions and\nresulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty. Here we explore\nthese ideas. We find that, despite ``low'' luminosities of LLAGN,\nunrealistically high stellar densities are required to make a sizable radiative\ncontribution to the (HST) optical/UV spectra of these galactic nuclei. Stellar\ncontribution to the infrared spectrum is more likely. Further, if LLAGN are in\na quasi steady-state for as long as 10^7 years or more, too high stellar\ndensities would again be required to significantly affect the dynamics of\naccretion flow. However, if LLAGN are ``short''-lived phenomena, e.g. t < 10^5\nyears, quiescent states of quiescence-outburst cycles, then embedded stars may\nbe much more important through the mass effects (iii) -- (v). With observations\nof LLAGN becoming progressively better, it will be more and more difficult to\nneglect the presence of close stars in and around nuclear accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 17:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our\ngoal is to elucidate the origins of X-rays in PMS stars by seeking out\nconnections between the X-rays and the mechanisms most likely driving their\nproduction--rotation and accretion. In our sample X-ray luminosity is\nsignificantly correlated with stellar rotation, in the sense of decreasing\nLx/Lbol with more rapid rotation, suggesting that these stars are in the\n\"super-saturated\" regime of the rotation-activity relationship. However, we\nalso find that stars with optical rotation periods are significantly biased to\nhigh Lx. This is not the result of magnitude bias in the optical\nrotation-period sample but rather to the diminishingly small amplitude of\noptical variations in stars with low Lx. Evidently, there exists in the ONC a\npopulation of stars whose rotation periods are unknown and that possess lower\naverage X-ray luminosities than those of stars with known rotation periods.\nThese stars may sample the linear regime of the rotation-activity relationship.\nAccretion also manifests itself in X-rays, though in a somewhat\ncounterintuitive fashion: While stars with spectroscopic signatures of\naccretion show harder X-ray spectra than non-accretors, they show lower X-ray\nluminosities and no enhancement of X-ray variability. We interpret these\nfindings in terms of a common origin for the X-ray emission observed from both\naccreting and non-accreting stars, with the X-rays from accreting stars simply\nbeing attenuated by magnetospheric accretion columns. This suggests that X-rays\nfrom PMS stars have their origins primarily in chromospheres, not accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 18:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The initial stellar models are modelled as relativistic\npolytropes which are either secularly or dynamically unstable and with angular\nvelocities which range from slow rotation to the mass-shedding limit.

The use of these\nsurfaces, together with the dynamical horizon framework, allows for a precise\nmeasurement of the black-hole mass and spin. The ability to successfully\nperform these simulations for sufficiently long times relies on excising a\nregion of the computational domain which includes the singularity and is within\nthe apparent horizon. The dynamics of the collapsing matter is strongly\ninfluenced by the initial amount of angular momentum in the progenitor star\nand, for initial models with sufficiently high angular velocities, the collapse\ncan lead to the formation of an unstable disc in differential rotation.

However, we also find evidence that for\na range of F the theory in the IR splits into a free \"magnetic\" gauge sector\nand an interacting superconformal sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 20:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The validity of this is examined for two simple cases: a\nlifetime measurement and a Poisson measurement. Results are compared with the\nexact Neyman construction and with the simple Bartlett approximation. It is\nshown that the accuracy of the log likelihood method is poor, and the Bartlett\nconstruction explains why it is flawed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 21:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The MD results not only show the\nexistence of fluid slip but also verify the validity of the Navier slip\nboundary condition. To better understand the fluid slip in this problem, a\ncontinuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated based upon the MD verification\nof the Navier boundary condition and the Newtonian stress. Our model has no\nadjustable parameter because all the material parameters (density, viscosity,\nand slip length) are directly determined from MD simulations. Steady-state\nvelocity fields from continuum calculations are in quantitative agreement with\nthose from MD simulations, from the molecular-scale structure to the global\nflow. The main discovery is as follows. In the immediate vicinity of the\ncorners where moving and fixed solid surfaces intersect, there is a core\npartial-slip region where the slippage is large at the moving solid surface and\ndecays away from the intersection quickly. In particular, the structure of this\ncore region is nearly independent of the system size. On the other hand, for\nsufficiently large system, an additional partial-slip region appears where the\nslippage varies as $1/r$ with $r$ denoting the distance from the corner along\nthe moving solid surface. The existence of this wide power-law region is in\naccordance with the asymptotic $1/r$ variation of stress and the Navier\nboundary condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2004 02:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Angular distribution of the particles scattered in\nthe Coulomb field is investigated on the rather large but finite distance r\nfrom the center. It is shown that the standard asymptotic representation of the\nwave functions is not available in the case when small scattering angles are\nconsidered. Unitary property of the scattering matrix is analyzed and the\n\"optical\" theorem for this case is discussed. The total and transport\ncross-sections for scattering of the particle by the Coulomb center proved to\nbe finite values and are calculated in the analytical form. It is shown that\nthe considered effects can be essential for the observed characteristics of the\ntransport processes in semiconductors which are defined by the electron and\nhole scattering in the fields of the charged impurity centers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2004 16:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
