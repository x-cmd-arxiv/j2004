Aiming to test such claims, the kinematic properties of\nself-consistent 3D N-body simulations of bar-unstable disks are studied. Using\nGauss-Hermite polynomials to describe the stellar kinematics, a number of\ncharacteristic bar signatures are identified in edge-on disks: 1) a major-axis\nlight profile with a quasi-exponential central peak and a plateau at moderate\nradii (Freeman Type II profile); 2) a ``double-hump'' rotation curve; 3) a\nsometime flat central velocity dispersion peak with a plateau at moderate radii\nand occasional local central minimum and secondary peak; 4) an h3-V correlation\nover the projected bar length. All those kinematic features are spatially\ncorrelated and can easily be understood from the orbital structure of barred\ndisks. They thus provide a reliable and easy-to-use tool to identify edge-on\nbars.

Unlike a typical situation in which a disordered secondary phase results\nin diffuse powder scattering, a serendipitous match between the in-plane\nlattice constant of NCCO and the lattice constant of one of the decomposition\nproducts, (Nd,Ce)2O3, causes the secondary phase to form an oriented,\nquasi-two-dimensional epitaxial structure.
