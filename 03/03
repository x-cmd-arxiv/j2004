This implies that the Andromeda\ngalaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream\nin different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,\ndisk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is\ncompressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the\nkinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of\n7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%\nconfidence level.

Furthermore, according to the best-fit orbit,\nthe stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure\nand producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby\nconfusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations.

During the circularization of their orbits, the dissipation\nof tidal disturbance by their host stars heats the interior and inflates the\nsizes of these planets. Based on a series of internal structure calculations\nfor giant planets, we examine the physical processes which determine their\nluminosity-radius relation. In order for young or intensely heated gas giant\nplanets to attain quasi-hydrostatic equilibria, with sizes comparable to or\nlarger than two Jupiter radii, their interiors must have sufficiently high\ntemperature and low density such that degeneracy effects are relatively weak\ncompared to those in a mature and compact Jupiter. Consequently, the polytropic\nindex monotonically increases whereas the central temperature increases and\nthen decreases with the planets' size. These effects, along with a\ntemperature-sensitive opacity for the radiative surface layers of giant\nplanets, cause the power index of the luminosity's dependence on radius to\ndecrease with increasing radius. For planets larger than twice Jupiter's\nradius, this index is sufficiently small that they become unstable to tidal\ninflation. We make comparisons between cases of uniform heating and cases in\nwhich the heating is concentrated in various locations within the giant planet.\nBased on these results we suggest that accurate measurement of the sizes of\nclose-in young Jupiters can be used to probe their internal structure under the\ninfluence of tidal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 02:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The gas-to-dust\nratio derived from the CO molecular gas distribution along the ISF is in the\nrange 30 - 200, which may be interpreted as being an effect of CO depletion due\nto the photodissociation and/or the freezing on dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 03:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In addition, it is found that the\ncollapse time decreases rapidly with the increase of the softcore radius. We\nfound that such an anomalously long collapse time is caused by the slow energy\nexchange between a higher-temperature compact core and relatively cold diluted\nhalo. The rate of energy exchange between the faster modes of the core\nparticles and slower-moving particles of the halo is exponentially small in the\nratio of the frequencies of these modes. As the softcore radius increases, and\nthe typical core modes become slower, the ratio of core and halo frequencies\ndecreases and the collapse accelerates. Implications to astrophysical systems\nand phase transition kinetics are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 04:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our major result is that the existence of static metrics on spacetimes\nand that of positive energy representations of symmetry groups, are equivalent\nto the existence of particular Adjoint-invariant convex cones in the symmetry\nalgebras. This can be used to study backgrounds of supergravity and string\ntheories through their symmetry groups. Our formalism is based on Segal's\napproach to infinitesimal causal structures on manifolds. The Adjoint action in\nthe symmetry group is shown to correspond to changes of inertial frames in the\nspacetime, whereas Adjoint-invariance encodes invariance under changes of\nobservers. This allows us to give a group theoretical description of the\nhorizon structure of spacetimes, and also to lift causal structures to the\nHilbert spaces of quantum theories.

This attraction affects the uniformity with\nwhich solutions of truncated equations converge pointwise to solutions of the\ncomplete gap and vertex equations. For current-quark masses less than the scale\nset by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the dependence of the\ndressed-quark-gluon vertex on the current-quark mass is weak. The study employs\na vertex model whose diagrammatic content is explicitly enumerable. That\nenables the systematic construction of a vertex-consistent Bethe-Salpeter\nkernel and thereby an exploration of the consequences for the strong\ninteraction spectrum of attraction in the colour-octet channel. With rising\ncurrent-quark mass the rainbow-ladder truncation is shown to provide an\nincreasingly accurate estimate of a bound state's mass. Moreover, the\ncalculated splitting between vector and pseudoscalar meson masses vanishes as\nthe current-quark mass increases, which argues for the mass of the pseudoscalar\npartner of the \\Upsilon(1S) to be above 9.4 GeV.

Our goal is to determine for which $\\rho$ universal\nquantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this\nquestion, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of\n$\\rho$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The\nprotocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain \"magic\"\ndirections. If the polarization of $\\rho$ along a magic direction exceeds a\nthreshold value (about 65%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure\nstate, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations\ncombined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection\nof our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 03:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2004 12:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-07"}

This raises the\nquestion of whether the time of flight of a quantum particle in a gravitational\nfield might deviate systematically from that of a classical particle due to\ntunnelling delay, representing a violation of the weak equivalence principle. I\ninvestigate this using a model quantum clock to measure the time of flight of a\nquantum particle in a uniform gravitational field, and show that a violation of\nthe equivalence principle does not occur when the measurement is made far from\nthe turning point of the classical trajectory.
