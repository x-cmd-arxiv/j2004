These galaxies are the\nfirst two observed from a complete sample of nine radio sources with redshifts\nin the range 1.3 < z < 1.5 (selected from the equatorial sample of powerful\nradio sources of Best, Rottgering & Lehnert), as part of a project aimed to\ninvestigate the multi-component nature of the UV continuum in radio galaxies\nand any variations of the continuum properties with the radio source age.\n  The larger radio source of the two, 0850-206, presents a high continuum\nfractional polarization, averaging 17% across the observed wavelength range and\nreaching 24% at rest-frame wavelengths of <2000 A. The smaller radio source,\n1303+091, shows a lower continuum polarization, averaging 8% and rising to 11%\nfor rest-frame wavelengths >3000 A. For both galaxies, the position angle of\nthe electric vector is generally constant with wavelength and within ~15\ndegrees of perpendicular to the radio axis. Both their total flux spectra and\npolarized flux spectra reveal the 2200 A dust feature, and comparison with dust\nscattering models suggests that the composition of the dust in these galaxies\nis similar to that of Galactic dust. In 0850-206, scattered quasar radiation\ndominates the UV continuum emission, with the nebular continuum accounting for\nno more than ~22% and no requirement for any additional emission component such\nas emission from young stars. By contrast, in 1303+091, unpolarized radiation\ncould be a major constituent of the UV continuum emission, with starlight\naccounting for up to ~50% and the nebular continuum accounting for ~11%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 21:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, it remains to be\nunderstood (1) why the brightness patterns producing them persist for up to 15\ns during an X-ray burst, whereas the burning should cover the entire surface in\nless than 1 s, and (2) why the frequencies drift upward by about 5 Hz during\nthe course of the burst.

To present day, isotopic enrichment of Si\nwas used in electronics for two goals: (i) fabrication of substrates with high\nlevel of doping and homogeneous distribution of impurities and (ii) for\nfabrication of substrates with enhanced heat conduction which allows further\nchips miniaturization. For the first purpose, enrichment of Si with Si-30 is\nused, because after irradiation of a Si ingot by the thermal neutron flux in a\nnuclear reactor, this isotope transmutes into a phosphorus atom which is a\ndonor impurity in Si. Enrichment of Si with Si-30 allows one to increase the\nlevel of doping up to a factor of 30 with a high homogeneity of the impurity\ndistribution. The second purpose is achieved in Si highly enriched with isotope\nSi-28, because mono-isotopic Si is characterized by enhanced thermal\nconductivity. New potential of isotopically engineered Si comes to light\nbecause of novel areas of fundamental and applied scientific activity connected\nwith spintronics and a semiconductor-based nuclear spin quantum computer where\nelectron and/or nuclear spins are the object of manipulation. In this case,\ncontrol of the abundance of nuclear spins is extremely important. Fortunately,\nSi allows such a control, because only isotope Si-29 has a non-zero nuclear\nspin. Therefore, enrichment or depletion of Si with isotope Si-29 will lead to\nthe creation of a material with a controlled concentration of nuclear spins.\nTwo examples of nano-devices for spintronics and quantum computation, based on\nisotopically engineered silicon, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2004 09:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a consequence, the right-hand side of a\nspinless-particle equation of motion (which would represent a gravitational\nforce) is always zero in the geometric description, but not in the teleparallel\ncase. This means essentially that the gravitational coupling prescription can\nbe minimal only in the geometric case. Relying on this property, a new\ngravitational coupling prescription in the presence of curvature and torsion is\nproposed. It is constructed in such a way to preserve the equivalence between\ncurvature and torsion, and its basic property is to be equivalent with the\nusual coupling prescription of general relativity. According to this view, no\nnew physics is connected with torsion, which appears as a mere alternative to\ncurvature in the description of gravitation. An application of this formulation\nto the equations of motion of both a spinless and a spinning particle is made\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2004 20:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the SRG scheme we compare\nthree different choices for the similarity factor. In (2+1) dimensions, in the\nlowest order, SRG produces linear confinement along the transverse direction\nbut only square root confinement along the longitudinal direction and thus\nbreaks the rotational symmetry. In the LFTL approach, we first investigate the\nproblem associated with fermion formulation on a LFTL. When the symmetric\nlattice derivative is used, the doublers arise due to decoupling of even and\nodd sub-lattices. We have discussed Wilson fermion and staggered fermion to\nremove the doublers. We propose another way of formulating fermions on LFTL by\nusing asymmetric lattice derivatives in such a way that the Hermiticity of the\nHamiltonian is preserved.

The localized electron wave function is evaluated\nwithin the atomistic tight-binding model. The magnetic field generated by the\nnuclear spins is estimated in the presence of an inhomogeneous environment\ncharacterized by a random nuclear spin configuration, by the dot-size\ndistribution, by alloy disorder, and by interface disorder. Due to these\ninhomogeneities, the magnitude of the nuclear magnetic field varies from one\nqubit to another by the order of 100 G, 100 G, 10 G, and 0.1 G, respectively.\nThe fluctuation of the magnetic field causes errors in exchange operations due\nto the inequality of the Zeeman splitting between two qubits.

For distinguishing between two mixed quantum states, we\ninvestigate the relation between the minimum error probability achievable in\nconclusive discrimination, and the minimum failure probability that can be\nreached in unambiguous discrimination of the same two states. The latter turns\nout to be at least twice as large as the former for any two given states.
