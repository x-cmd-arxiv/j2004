Motivated by inner halo satellite remnants like the Sgr and Omega Cen,\nwe develop fully analytical models to study the orbital decay and tidal\nmassloss of satellites. The orbital decay rate is often severely overestimated\nif applying the ChandraSekhar's formula without correcting for (a) the\nevaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction of\nsatellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over the\nHubble time. As a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo density\naffects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number of\nhalo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational \"wake\", hence increasing\nthe drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which \"peels off\" the\nsatellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake. These competing processes can\nbe modeled analytically for a satellite with the help of an empirical formula\nfor the massloss history. The analytical model agrees with more numerical\nsimulations of tidal massloss and dynamical friction. Rapid massloss due to\nincreasing tides at ever smaller radius makes it less likely for streams or\nremnants of infalling satellites to intrude the inner halo (as the Sgr stream\nand oCen) than to stay in the outer halo (Magellanic stream), hence any\nintermediate-mass central black holes of the satellites are also likely \"hung\nup\" at large distances as well.

Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies.
