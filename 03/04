We used an archival\nVLT/UVES data set to apply this method to HD209458. The amplitude of the\nRossiter effect is shown to be 1.7+-1.2 m/sec higher in the Sodium D lines than\nin the weighted average of all other absorption lines in the observed\nwavelength range, corresponding to an increment of 4.3+-3% (1.4 sigma). The\nuncertainty in this measurement compares to a photometric accuracy of 5e-4 for\nconventional atmospheric transmission spectroscopy, more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than previous attempts using ground-based telescopes.\nObservations specifically designed for this method could increase the accuracy\nfurther by a factor 2-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2004 21:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This pertains to the study of\nluminous low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). When pointed at the Galactic center,\nthe WFC field of view contains more than half of the Galactic LMXB population.\nThe results exemplify the excellent WFC capability to detect brief X-ray\ntransients. Firstly, the WFCs expanded the known population of Galactic\nthermonuclear X-ray bursters by 50%. At least half of all LMXBs are now\nestablished to burst and, thus, to contain a neutron star as compact accretor\nrather than a black hole candidate. We provide a complete list of all 76\ncurrently known bursters, including the new case 1RXS J170854.4-321857.\nSecondly, the WFCs have uncovered a population of weak transients with peak\nluminosities up to ~10^37 erg/s and durations from days to weeks. One is the\nfirst accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. Thirdly, the WFCs\ncontributed considerably towards establishing that nearly all (12 out of 13)\nluminous low-mass X-ray binaries in Galactic globular clusters contain neutron\nstars rather than black holes. Thus, the neutron star to black hole ratio in\nclusters differs from that in the Galactic disk at a marginal confidence level\nof 97%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2004 13:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

First, the calculations extend previous studies of\nmagnetized shear flows to a higher compressibility regime. The nonlinear\nevolution of an isolated KH billow emerging from the fastest growing linear\nmode for a convective sonic Mach number $M_{cs}=0.7$ layer is in many respects\nsimilar to its less compressible counterpart (Mach $M_{cs}=0.5$).

Biological evolution\nhas generated a rich variety of successful solutions, which have inspired\nengineers to design optimized artificial systems.

However, can this strategy cope\nwith bottleneck situations, when interactions cause delays that reduce the\noverall flow? Here, we present an experimental study of ants confronted with\ntwo alternative routes. We find that pheromone-based attraction generates one\ntrail at low densities, whereas at a high level of crowding, another trail is\nestablished before traffic volume is affected, which guarantees that an optimal\nrate of food return is maintained. This bifurcation phenomenon is explained by\na nonlinear modelling approach. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism is based\non inhibitory interactions. It implies capacity reserves, a limitation of the\ndensity-induced speed reduction, and a sufficient pheromone concentration for\nreliable trail perception.

The other Riemann surface\nappears when the radial wave equation is interpreted as the Fuchsian\ndifferential equation. We study these surfaces in detail for the BTZ and\nSchwarzschild black holes in four and higher dimensions. Topologically, in all\ncases both surfaces are a sphere with a set of marked points; for BTZ and 4D\nSchwarzschild black holes there is 3 marked points. In certain limits the\nsurfaces can be characterized very explicitly. We then show how properties of\nthe wave equation (quasi-normal modes) in such limits are encoded in the\ngeometry of the corresponding surfaces. In particular, for the Schwarzschild\nblack hole in the high damping limit we describe the Riemann surface in\nquestion and use this to derive the quasi-normal mode frequencies with the\nlog(3) as the real part.

Indeed, it doubled with improving conditions in humans; increased\n2.4-fold with genotype change in Drosophila, and 6-fold (to 430 years in human\nterms), with no apparent loss in health and vitality, in nematodes with a small\nnumber of perturbed genes and tissues. The law suggests a physical mechanism of\nthe universal mortality and its regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2004 14:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 15:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Spontaneous\nemission in a random direction is the dissipative mechanism required to remove\nentropy from the atom. However, alternative cooling methods have been proposed\nfor a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity; the role of\nspontaneous emission is replaced by the escape of a photon from the cavity.\nApplication of such cooling schemes would improve the performance of atom\ncavity systems for quantum information processing. Furthermore, as cavity\ncooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems\nthat cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules\n(which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose\ncondensates, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we\ndemonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity\ndipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and\nimproved localization of atoms.

In this work, we continue our investigation of the\nnotion of generalized entanglement [Barnum et al. Phys. Rev. A 68, 032308\n(2003)] by focusing on a simple Lie-algebraic measure of purity of a quantum\nstate relative to an observable set. For the algebra of local observables on\nmulti-qubit systems, the resulting local purity measure is equivalent to a\nrecently introduced global entanglement measure [Meyer and Wallach, J. Math.\nPhys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. In the condensed-matter setting, the notion of\nLie-algebraic purity is exploited to identify and characterize the quantum\nphase transitions present in two exactly solvable models: the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a\ntransverse magnetic field. For the latter, we argue that a natural fermionic\nobservable-set arising after the Jordan-Wigner transformation, better\ncharacterizes the transition than alternative measures based on qubits. This\nillustrates the usefulness of going beyond the standard subsystem-based\nframework while providing a global disorder parameter for this model. Our\nresults show how generalized entanglement leads to useful tools for\ndistinguishing between the ordered and disordered phases in the case of broken\nsymmetry quantum phase transitions.
