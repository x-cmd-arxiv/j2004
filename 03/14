Weaker evidence suggests such variability on a few other nights for\ntwo other objects, but the data are not as convincing. Intra-night variability\nin NLS1s is thus concluded to be rare and of low amplitude. We give\nillustrations of how variable image quality can produce spurious variability.\nWe find that for well-studied non-NLS1s there is a spread in the amplitude of\nseasonal variability (i.e., in some years an AGN is more variable than in\nothers). We find that the means of the variability amplitudes of non-NLS1s over\nseveral seasons vary from object to object (i.e., some AGNs are, on average,\nmore variable than others). NLS1s also show a spread in seasonal variabilities.\nThe best-studied NLS1, Ark 564, shows a range of amplitudes of variability from\nseason to season that is comparable to the range found in BLS1s, and in one\nseason Ark 564 was as variable as the most variable non-NLS1. The seasonal\namplitudes of variability for NLS1s are mostly in the lower half of the range\nof non-BLS1 seasonal amplitudes, but the absence of a suitable control sample\nmakes a precise comparison difficult. However, on long timescales (weeks to\nyears), NLS1s as a class are not more variable than non-NLS1s. The extreme\nvariability seen in the X-rays was not seen in the optical. This has\nconsequences for the models of AGNs in general as well as NLS1s in particular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 2004 04:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The calculation is performed for both angular\nindependent and dependent parts. We separate the corrections into the outer and\ninner parts {\\` a} la Sirlin.

The calculation of the outer part\nis straightforward, but that of the inner part requires a scrutiny concerning\nthe continuation of the long-distance hadronic calculation to the\nshort-distance quark treatment and the dependence on the model of hadron\nstructure. We show that the logarithmically divergent parts do not depend on\nthe structure of hadrons not only for the Fermi part, but also for the\nGamow-Teller part. This observation enables us to deal with the inner part for\nthe Gamow-Teller transition nearly parallel to that for the Fermi transition.\nThe inner part is universal to weak charged-current processes and can be\nabsorbed into the modification of the coupling constants up to the order of the\ninverse proton mass $O(1/m_{p})$.
