This effect can give an understanding of recent experiments\non mesoscopic devices as quantum point contacts showing the 0.7 conductance\nanomaly and the wide number of data about saturation of dephasing time observed\nat very low temperatures, as a fully polarized two dimensional electron gas.\nBut similar effects can be seen in different area of physics as for example the\nDicke model describing the interaction of two-level systems with a radiation\nmode. In this case one can show that decoherence is intrinsic and remove a\nSchr\\\"odinger cat state leaving a single coherent state, collapsing the wave\nfunction in the thermodynamic limit. So, saturation of dephasing time at low\ntemperatures in mesoscopic devices can be understood by a fully polarized two\ndimensional electron gas that, by an exchange model, can be reduced to a\ngeneralized form of the Dicke Hamiltonian and where the quasiparticles are spin\nexcitations interacting with magnons. In this way, one can see that several\nexperiments on nanowires and quantum dots can be satisfactorily explained. The\nexistence of intrinsic decoherence in the thermodynamic limit could have deep\nimplications in fundamental problems like quantum measurement and\nirreversibility.

The rapid development of quantum computation in\nrecent years stimulates us to establish a theory of computation based on\nquantum logic.

It is\nfound that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily\nupon the distributivity of the underlying logic.
