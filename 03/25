All the tests give the\nsame result: a defect of stars in the inner disc with respect to an exponential\ndisc (either with constant scaleheight or extrapolated from the outer disc),\nbut only in near plane regions. This deficit might be interpreted as a flare in\nthe vertical distribution. The in-plane density is almost independent of R and\nnot an exponential law. Further away from the plane, however, the density\nincreases towards the centre due to the increase of the scaleheight. Tests also\nshow that this result cannot be due to extinction.
