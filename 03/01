The 3-D simulation ran over one hundred light-crossing time\nunits ($\\tau_{\\rm S} = r_{\\rm S}/c$ where $r_{\\rm S} \\equiv 2GM/c^2$) which is\nconsiderably longer than the previous simulations. We show that the jet is\ninitially formed as predicted due in part to magnetic pressure from the\ntwisting the initially uniform magnetic field and from gas pressure associated\nwith shock formation in the region around $r = 3 r_{\\rm S}$. At later times,\nthe accretion disk becomes thick and the jet fades resulting in a wind that is\nejected from the surface of the thickened (torus-like) disk. It should be noted\nthat no streaming matter from a donor is included at the outer boundary in the\nsimulation (an isolated black hole not binary black hole). The wind flows\noutwards with a wider angle than the initial jet. The widening of the jet is\nconsistent with the outward moving torsional Alfv\\'{e}n waves (TAWs). This\nevolution of disk-jet coupling suggests that the jet fades with a thickened\naccretion disk due to the lack of streaming material from an accompanying star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2004 15:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2005 17:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2005 19:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This information can be obtained from a sum of functions,\nlargely used in fitting of experimental data. These functions were chosen\nbecause their centre and weight yield a good description of the water basin\nbehaviour. The coefficients of these functions are here extracted using results\nof measured and / or calculated data for the state variables describing the\nshallow West Lake, Hangzou. This procedure can also be applied to other shallow\nlakes, generating geological information about their drainage basin, which is\none of the most important parameters to describe their micrometeorological\nbehaviour. One concludes this work emphasizing the relevance of the explicit\ntime dependence of the drainage variables and the requirement of measured data\nto validate this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2004 14:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
