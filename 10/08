The energy current is related to one of the non-trivial conserved\nquantities underlying integrability and therefore both the diagonal and off\ndiagonal dynamical correlations of spin and energy current diverge. The\nenergy-energy and spin-energy current correlations at finite temperatures are\nexactly calculated by a lattice path integral formulation. The low-temperature\nbehavior of the thermomagnetic (magnetic Seebeck) coefficient is also\ndiscussed.

These studies have been complemented in recent years by\nobserving the dependence of such spectra on isotopic mass whenever different\nstable isotopes of a given atom are available at affordable prices. In crystals\ncomposed of different atoms, the effect of the vibration of each separate atom\ncan thus be investigated by isotopic substitution. Because of the zero-point\nvibrations, such effects are present even at zero temperature (T = 0). In this\npaper we discuss state-of-the-art calculations of the dielectric function\nspectra and compare them with experimental results, with emphasis on the\ndifferences introduced by the electron-phonon interaction.

Little is known about the fundamental theory valid at Planckian\nenergies, except that it necessarily seems to imply the occurrence of a minimal\nlength scale, providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff and a limit to the\npossible resolution of spacetime.\n  Motivated by String Theory, the models of large extra dimensions lower the\nPlanck scale to values soon accessible. These models predict a vast number of\nquantum gravity effects at the lowered Planck scale, among them the production\nof TeV-mass black holes and gravitons. Within the extra dimensional scenario,\nalso the minimal length comes into the reach of experiment and sets a\nfundamental limit to short distance physics.\n  We review the status of Planck scale physics in these effective models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 00:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The objective\nof (MS) is to select the optimal single estimator from the list; that of (C) is\nto select the optimal convex combination of the given estimators; and that of\n(L) is to select the optimal linear combination of the given estimators. We are\ninterested in evaluating the rates of convergence of the excess risks of the\nestimators obtained by these procedures. Our approach is motivated by recent\nminimax results in Nemirovski (2000) and Tsybakov (2003).\n  There exist competing aggregation procedures achieving optimal convergence\nseparately for each one of (MS), (C) and (L) cases. Since the bounds in these\nresults are not directly comparable with each other, we suggest an alternative\nsolution. We prove that all the three optimal bounds can be nearly achieved via\na single \"universal\" aggregation procedure.

It is shown\nthat an effective treatment of the correction using a Lamb-shift \"potential\"\nleads to equivalent results in both the length as well as the velocity gauges\nprovided all relevant correction terms are taken into account. Specifically,\nthe relevant radiative corrections are related to the energies that enter into\nthe propagator denominators, to the Hamiltonian, to the wave functions, and to\nthe energy conservation condition that holds between the two photons; the form\nof all of these effects is different in the two gauges, but the final result is\nshown to be gauge invariant, as it should be. Although the actual calculation\nonly involves integrations over nonrelativistic hydrogenic Green functions, the\nderivation of the leading logarithmic correction can be regarded as slightly\nmore complex than that of other typical logarithmic terms. The dominant\nradiative correction to the 2S two-photon decay width is found to be -2.020536\n(alpha/pi) (Zalpha)^2 ln[(Zalpha)^-2] in units of the leading nonrelativistic\nexpression. This result is in agreement with a length-gauge calculation [S. G.\nKarshenboim and V. G. Ivanov, e-print physics/9702027], where the coefficient\nwas given as -2.025(1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 15:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Usually QM is\nformulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a\npriori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion\nof velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1.\nThe problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is\ndefinitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty\nprinciple of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position\nand momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined\napproximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the\nvelocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle,\nand time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually\nsupposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time\nproper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum\nmechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are\nunique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the\nmotion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWe investigate such motion in a given local system in part II. This is a usual\nquantum mechanics. After some excursion of the investigation of local motion,\nwe consider in part III the relative relation or motion between plural local\nsystems. In the final part IV, we will prove that there is at least one\nUniverse wave function $\\phi$ in which all local systems have local motions and\nthus local times. This concludes our formulation of Quantum Mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 00:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2005 02:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2005 10:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2009 10:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2011 10:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-10"}
