Much of the progress in understanding the physics of\nhigh redshift universe and comparison with observations would not have been\npossible without N-Body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is\nessential to understand its limitations as ignoring the limitations can easily\nlead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the\nlimitations arising out of the finite size of simulation volume. This finite\nsize implies that modes larger than the size of the simulation volume are\nignored and a truncated power spectrum is simulated. If the simulation volume\nis large enough then the mass in collapsed haloes expected from the full power\nspectrum and from the truncated power spectrum should match. We propose a\nquantitative measure based on this approach that allows us to compute the\nminimum box size for an N-Body simulation. We find that the required box size\nfor simulations of LCDM model at high redshifts is much larger than is\ntypically used. We can also use this approach to quantify the effect of\nperturbations at large scales for power law models and we find that if we fix\nthe scale of non-linearity, the required box size becomes very large as the\nindex becomes small. The appropriate box size computed using this approach is\nalso an appropriate choice for the transition scale when tools like MAP (Tormen\nand Bertschinger, 1996) that add the contribution of the missing power are\nused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2004 10:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2005 09:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead, consistency\nunder certain extreme circumstances is provided by two effects. The first is\nsimply the exponential enhancement of the rate at which a macrostate with large\nentropy is emitted in any thermal process. The second is a new sense in which\nthe entropy of an ``object'' depends on the observer making the measurement, so\nthat observers crossing the horizon measure a different entropy flux across the\nhorizon than do observers remaining outside. In addition to the review, some\nrecent criticisms are addressed.

All atom molecular\ndynamics simulations of a nucleosome and of its 146 basepairs of DNA free in\nsolution have been conducted. DNA helical parameters are extracted from each\ntrajectory to compare the conformation, effective force constants, persistence\nlength measures, and fluctuations of nucleosomal DNA to free DNA. A method for\ndisassembling and reconstructing the conformation and dynamics of the\nnucleosome using Fourier analysis is presented. Results indicate that the\nsuperhelical path of DNA in the nucleosome is irregular. Long length variations\nin the conformation of nucleosomal DNA are identified other than those\nassociated with helix repeat. These variations are required to create a\nproposed tetrasome conformation or to qualitatively reconstruct the 1.75 turns\nof the nuclesomal superhelix. Free DNA achieves enough bend and shear in\nsolution to create an ideal nucleosome superhelix, but these deformations are\nnot organized so the conformation is essentially linear. Reconstruction of free\nDNA using selected long wavelength variations in conformation can produce\neither a left-handed or a right-handed superhelix. DNA is less flexible in the\nnucleosome than when free in solution, however such measures are length scale\ndependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2004 19:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Intriguingly, it has been observed\nin numerous developmental contexts, and particularly hematopoiesis, that genes\nregulating differentiation are initially co-expressed in progenitors despite\ntheir antagonism, before one is upregulated and others downregulated. We\ncharacterise conditions under which 3 classes of generic \"master regulatory\nnetworks\", modelled at the molecular level after experimentally-observed\ninteractions (including bHLH protein dimerisation), and including an arbitrary\nnumber of antagonistic components, can behave as a \"multi-switch\", directing\ndifferentiation in an all-or-none fashion to a specific cell-type chosen among\nmore than 2 possible outcomes. bHLH dimerisation networks can readily display\ncoexistence of many antagonistic factors when competition is low (a simple\ncharacterisation is derived). Decision-making can be forced by a transient\nincrease in competition, which could correspond to some unexplained\nexperimental observations related to Id proteins; the speed of response varies\nwith the initial conditions the network is subjected to, which could explain\nsome aspects of cell behaviour upon reprogramming. The coexistence of\nantagonistic factors at low levels, early in the differentiation process or in\npluripotent stem cells, could be an intrinsic property of the interaction\nbetween those factors, not requiring a specific regulatory system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2004 21:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is defined as the overlap of two\nwave functions evolved from the same initial state but with slightly different\nHamiltonians. Thus, it also serves as a quantification of irreversibility in\nquantum mechanics.\n  In this thesis the LE is studied in systems that have a classical counterpart\nwith dynamical instability, that is, classically chaotic. An analytical\ntreatment that makes use of the semiclassical approximation is presented. It is\nshown that, under certain regime of the parameters, the LE decays\nexponentially. Furthermore, for strong enough perturbations, the decay rate is\ngiven by the Lyapunov exponent of the classical system. Some particularly\ninteresting examples are given.\n  The analytical results are supported by thorough numerical studies. In\naddition, some regimes not accessible to the theory are explored, showing that\nthe LE and its Lyapunov regime present the same form of universality ascribed\nto classical chaos. In a sense, this is evidence that the LE is a robust\ntemporal signature of chaos in the quantum realm.\n  Finally, the relation between the LE and the quantum to classical transition\nis explored, in particular with the theory of decoherence. Using two different\napproaches, a semiclassical approximation to Wigner functions and a master\nequation for the LE, it is shown that the decoherence rate and the decay rate\nof the LE are equal. The relationship between these quantities results mutually\nbeneficial, in terms of the broader resources of decoherence theory and of the\npossible experimental realization of the LE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2004 13:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
