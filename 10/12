We found evidence for a new periodicity that we interpret as a\nsuperhump in Algol, in which it may have been expected according to its\nsemi-detached nature and low binary mass ratio. This is the first detection of\nthe superhump phenomenon in the radio and the first observation of superhumps\nin Algol systems. According to our result, the accretion disk in Algol\nprecesses in spite of its non-Keplerian nature and therefore this phenomenon is\nnot restricted to the classical Keplerian disks in compact binaries.We propose\nthat in Algol systems with short orbital periods, the disk is magnetically\nactive as well as the secondary star. The magnetic field in the disk originates\nfrom amplification of the seed field in the magnetized material transferred\nfrom the secondary. The disk and stellar fields interact with each other, with\nreconnection of the field lines causing flares and particle acceleration.\nRelativistic particles are trapped in the field and directed toward the polar\nregions of the secondary star because of the dipole structure of its magnetic\nfield. Our proposed model for the magnetic activity in Algol systems provides a\nsimple explanation to the observed properties of Algol in the radio\nwavelengths, and to the presence of quiescent gyrosynchrotron emission near the\npolar region of the secondary star, where electrons are difficult to be\nconfined if the field lines are open as in normal single magnetic stars. We\npropose that the superhump variation in the radio is generated by enhanced\nreconnection when the elongated side of the elliptic disk is the closest to the\ncool star. This leads to flares and enhancement in particle acceleration and is\nmanifested as stronger gyrosynchrotron radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 16:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A first result is the numerical evidence of the existence of two\ndifferent kinds of transitions in the dynamics of the FPU models: i) a\nStochasticity Threshold (ST), characterized by a value of the energy per degree\nof freedom below which the overwhelming majority of the phase space\ntrajectories are regular (vanishing Lyapunov exponents). It tends to vanish as\nthe number N of degrees of freedom is increased. ii) a Strong Stochasticity\nThreshold (SST), characterized by a value of the energy per degree of freedom\nat which a crossover appears between two different power laws of the energy\ndependence of the largest Lyapunov exponent, which phenomenologically\ncorresponds to the transition between weakly and strongly chaotic regimes. It\nis stable with N. A second result is the development of a Riemannian geometric\ntheory to explain the origin of Hamiltonian chaos. The starting of this theory\nhas been motivated by the inadequacy of the approach based on homoclinic\nintersections to explain the origin of chaos in systems of arbitrarily large N,\nor arbitrarily far from quasi-integrability, or displaying a transition between\nweak and strong chaos.\n  Finally, a third result stems from the search for the transition between weak\nand strong chaos in systems other than FPU.\n  Actually, we found that a very sharp SST appears as the dynamical counterpart\nof a thermodynamic phase transition, which in turn has led, in the light of the\nRiemannian theory of chaos, to the development of a topological theory of phase\ntransitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 12:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

A\ndeformed configuration of the rod is described by the displacement vector of\nthe deformed centroid curves and an orthonormal moving frame, rigidly attached\nto the cross-section of the rod.

By separated we mean two systems prepared in\ndifferent ``rooms'' of the lab, and before any interaction takes place. In that\ncase the state of the compound system is necessarily a product state. As a\nconsequence, Dirac's superposition principle fails, and therefore L_sep cannot\nsatisfy all Piron's axioms. In previous works, assuming that L_sep is\northocomplemented, it was argued that L_sep is not orthomodular and fails to\nhave the covering property.

In general the information is a\nmixture of local, and non-local (\"quantum\") information. To make this point\nmore clear, we develop and investigate the quantum information processing\nparadigm in which parties sharing a multipartite state distill local\ninformation. The amount of information which is lost because the parties must\nuse a classical communication channel is the deficit. This scheme can be viewed\nas complementary to the notion of distilling entanglement. After reviewing the\nparadigm, we show that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative\nentropy distance to so-called psuedo-classically correlated states; the lower\nbound is the relative entropy of entanglement. This implies, in particular,\nthat any entangled state is informationally nonlocal i.e. has nonzero deficit.\nWe also apply the paradigm to defining the thermodynamical cost of erasing\nentanglement. We show the cost is bounded from below by relative entropy of\nentanglement. We demonstrate the existence of several other non-local\nphenomena. For example,we prove the existence of a form of non-locality without\nentanglement and with distinguishability. We analyze the deficit for several\nclasses of multipartite pure states and obtain that in contrast to the GHZ\nstate, the Aharonov state is extremely nonlocal (and in fact can be thought of\nas quasi-nonlocalisable). We also show that there do not exist states, for\nwhich the deficit is strictly equal to the whole informational content (bound\nlocal information). We then discuss complementary features of information in\ndistributed quantum systems. Finally we discuss the physical and theoretical\nmeaning of the results and pose many open questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 14:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
