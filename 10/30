We find configurations in which the neutralino\nrelic density is set by coannihilations with a long-lived stau, and the late\ndecay of staus partially suppresses the linear matter power spectrum. Nonlinear\nevolution on small scales then causes the modified linear power spectrum to\nevolve to a nonlinear power spectrum similar (but different in detail) to\nmodels parametrized by a constant running $\\alpha_{s}=d n_{s}/d{\\rm ln} k$ by\nredshifts of 2 to 4.

This work is motivated in\npart by questions arising from recent spectroscopic measurements revealing\ndiscrepancies with present theoretical descriptions. Many of the current\nradiative property models for plasmas include only single electron-emitter\ncollisions and neglect some or all charge-charge interactions. A molecular\ndynamics simulation of dipole relaxation is proposed here to allow proper\naccount of many electron-emitter interactions and all charge-charge couplings.\nAs illustrations, molecular dynamics simulations are reported for the cases of\na single ion imbedded in an electron plasma and for a two-component\nion-electron plasma. Ion-ion, electron-ion, and electron-electron coupling\neffects are discussed for hydrogen-like Balmer alpha lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 21:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We extend the\nanalysis through December 2003 using the latest updates of the observational\ntemperature and solar irradiance data sets in addition to a new volcano proxy\ndata set. We have re-determined the solar effect on the temperature from\nsatellite measurements of the solar irradiance and the temperature of the lower\ntroposphere the sensitivity to solar irradiance. This re-analysis calculates\ntwo newly recognized dynamic and non-radiative flux factors which must be\napplied to the observed sensitivity. The sensitivity is about twice that\nexpected from a no-feedback Stefan-Boltzmann radiation balance model, which\nimplies positive feedback. The sensitivity to volcano forcing is also\ndetermined. Preliminary results indicate that negative feedback is present in\nthis case. Response times of fractions of a year are found for both solar and\nvolcano forcing. We note that climate models generally assume relaxation times\nof 5 to 10 years and we comment on the consequences of this large disparity. We\nalso have determined a linear trend in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2004 11:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16\ninto the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an a-helix with a trans-bilayer\norientation. We observe that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer\nprecedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some\npropensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of\nthe DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather\nan off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that\nthe observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force\n(PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show\nthat the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy\nthan other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer\nwithout regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10\nkcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the\ndominant conceptual model, which is that a surface bound helix is an obligatory\nintermediate for the insertion of a-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In\nour simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a\nlarge (> 100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the\nunstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The\ninsertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on\nthe near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests that\nintrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors\ndepending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 22:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
