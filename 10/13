They are obtained from the wave functions of the non\nrelativistic CQM of Isgur and Karl, convoluted with the helicity-dependent GPDs\nof the constituent quarks themselves. The latter are modelled by using the\npolarized structure functions of the constituent quark, the double distribution\nrepresentation of GPDs, and a phenomenological constituent quark form factor.\nThe present approach permits to access a kinematical range corresponding to\nboth the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi and the\nEfremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage regions, for small values of the momentum\ntransfer and of the skewedness parameter. In this kinematical region, the\npresent calculation represents a prerequisite for the evaluation of cross\nsections relevant to deeply virtual Compton scattering. In particular, we have\ncalculated the leading twist helicity-dependent GPD \\tilde H and, from our\nexpressions, its general relations with the non relativistic definition of the\naxial form factor and with the leading twist polarized quark density are\nconsistently recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2004 14:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2004 15:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Recently we introduced a\nnovel method, termed `volatility', to estimate selection pressures on protein\nsequences from their synonymous codon usage (Plotkin and Dushoff 2003, Plotkin\net al 2004a). Here we provide a theoretical foundation for this approach. We\nderive the expected frequencies of synonymous codons as a function of the\nstrength of selection, the mutation rate, and the effective population size. We\nanalyze the conditions under which we can expect to draw inferences from biased\ncodon usage, and we estimate the time scales required to establish and maintain\nsuch a signal. Our results indicate that, over a broad range of parameters,\nsynonymous codon usage can reliably distinguish between negative selection,\npositive selection, and neutrality. While the power of volatility to detect\nnegative selection depends on the population size, there is no such dependence\nfor the detection of positive selection. Furthermore, we show that phenomena\nsuch as transient hyper-mutators in microbes can improve the power of\nvolatility to detect negative selection, even when the typical observed neutral\nsite heterozygosity is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Oct 2004 04:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

This circumvents several technical as well\nas conceptual issues that arise when dealing with an infinite dimensional\nHilbert space as in the analysis of conventional Stern-Gerlach experiment. Here\nalso it is demonstrated that the response of the detector is continuous and it\n{\\it directly} measures {\\em expectation values without altering the state of\nthe system}(when the unknown original state is a {\\it nondegenerate eigenstate\nof the system Hamiltonian}, in the limit of {\\em ideal} adiabatic conditions.\nWe have also computed the corrections arising out of the inevitable departures\nfrom ideal adiabaticity i.e the time of measurement being large but finite. To\novercome the {\\em conceptual} difficulties with a {\\it quantum apparatus}, we\nhave simulated a {\\it classical apparatus} as a {\\em large} assembly of\nspin-1/2 systems.
