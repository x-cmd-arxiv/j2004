We also show that for eccentric orbits the explicit\ndependence of the Coulomb logarithm on position yields significant differences\nfor the standard homogeneous force.

The orbital fits in the first few\nperiods are further improved, but the deviations at later times are much\nlarger. The additional force induced by the density gradient, the inhomogeneous\nforce, is not antiparallel to the satellite motion and can exceed 10% of the\nhomogeneous friction force in magnitude. However, due to the symmetry\nproperties of the inhomogeneous force, there is a deformation and no secular\neffect on the orbit at the first order. Therefore the inhomogeneous force can\nbe safely neglected for the orbital evolution of satellite galaxies. For the\nhomogeneous force we compare numerical N-body calculations with semi-analytical\norbits to determine quantitatively the accuracy of the generalized formulae of\nthe Coulomb logarithm in the Chandresekhar approach.

When the\ncritical temperature of the Mott transition is much higher than the quantum\ndegeneracy temperature, the transition is essentially described by the Ising\nuniversality class. Below the critical temperature, phase separation or\nfirst-order transition occurs. However, if the critical point is involved in\nthe Fermi degeneracy region, a marginal quantum critical point appears at zero\ntemperature. The originally single Mott critical point generates subsequent\nmany unstable fixed points through various Fermi surface instabilities induced\nby the Mott criticality characterized by the diverging charge susceptibility or\ndoublon susceptibility. This occurs in marginal quantum-critical region.\nCharge, magnetic and superconducting instabilitites compete severely under\nthese critical charge fluctuations. The quantum Mott transition triggers\nmulti-furcating criticality, which goes beyond the conventional concept of\nmulticriticality in quantum phase transitions. Near the quantum Mott\ntransition, the criticality generically drives growth of inhomogeneous\nstructure in the momentum space with singular points of flat dispersion on the\nFermi surface. The singular points determine the quantum dynamics of the Mott\ntransition by the dynamical exponent $z=4$. We argue that many of\nfilling-control Mott transitions are classified to this category.

The presence of\nthe nonvanishing pion mass tames the aforementioned enhancement, giving rise to\na finite value for the running coupling at the origin. In addition, the\neffective charge acquires a \"plateau-like\" behavior in the low energy region of\nthe timelike domain. This plateau is found to be in agreement with a number of\nphenomenological models for the strong running coupling. The developed\ninvariant charge is applied in the processing of experimental data on the\ninclusive $\\tau$ lepton decay.

Because of symmetry the number density of vacua with a certain\nhierarchically-small Higgs mass diverges, and is an attractor on the vacuum\nlandscape.The hierarchy problem is solved in two steps. It is first promoted\ninto a problem of the super-selection rule among the infinite number of vacua\n(analogous to theta-vacua in QCD), that are finely scanned by the Higgs mass.\nThis rule is lifted by heavy branes, which effectively convert the Higgs mass\ninto a dynamical variable. The key point is that a discrete\n\"brane-charge-conjugation\" symmetry guarantees that the fineness of the\nvacuum-scanning is set by the Higgs mass itself. On a resulting landscape in\nall, but a measure-zero set of vacua the Higgs mass has a common\nhierarchically-small value. In minimal models this value is controlled by the\nQCD scale and is of the right magnitude. Although in each particular vacuum\nthere is no visible UV-regulating low energy physics, the realistic models are\npredictive.

These are extensions of relevant work of Gromov, McDuff and Taubes\non symplectic 4-manifolds concerning pseudoholomorphic curves and\nSeiberg-Witten theory. They form the technical backbone of the proof that a\nsymplectic s-cobordism of elliptic 3-manifolds (with a canonical contact\nstructure on the boundary) is smoothly a product. One interesting feature of\nthe theory is that existence of pseudoholomorphic curves gives certain\nrestrictions on the singular points of the 4-orbifold contained by the\npseudoholomorphic curves. In the last section, we discuss applications (or\npotential ones) of the theory in some other problems such as symplectic finite\ngroup actions on 4-manifolds, symplectic circle actions on 6-manifolds, and\nalgebraic surfaces with quotient singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2004 19:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2005 18:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
