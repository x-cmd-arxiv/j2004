Thermal launching is possible when the accreted material is\nstrongly shocked due to large gradients of physical quantities in the boundary\nlayer (or at the inner boundary of a truncated disk) and then cools on a time\nscale longer than its ejection time from the disk. In our framework the\nmagnetic fields are weak, and serve only to recollimate the outflow at large\ndistances from the source, or to initiate the shock, but not as a jet-driving\nagent. Using criteria for shock formation and mass ejection, we find the mass\naccretion rate above which jets can be launched from boundary layers around\naccreting white dwarfs to be ~10^{-6} Mo/y, which explains the absence of jets\nin cataclysmic variable stars and their presence in other white-dwarf accreting\nsystems such as super-soft X-ray sources, symbiotic stars and classical novae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2004 16:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This model challenges our\ncurrent understanding of the densities associated with the internal layers of\nthe Sun, advocating a relatively constant density, almost independent of radial\nposition. The incompressible nature of liquids is advanced to prevent solar\ncollapse from gravitational forces. The liquid plasma model of the Sun is a\nnon-equilibrium approach, where nuclear reactions are free to occur throughout\nthe solar mass. The primary means of addressing internal heat transfer are\nconvection and conduction. As a result of the convective processes on the solar\nsurface, the liquid model brings into question the established temperature of\nthe solar photosphere by highlighting a violation of Kirchhoff's law of thermal\nemission. Along these lines, the model emphasizes that radiative emission is a\nsurface phenomenon. Strong evidence is provided that the Sun is a high\ndensity/high energy liquid plasma. This evidence is based on our knowledge of\nPlanckian thermal emission and condensed matter, including the existence of\npressure ionization and liquid metallic hydrogen at high temperatures and\npressures. The equations of magnetohydrodynamics are invoked as the proper\nvehicle for the understanding od stellar convection and structure.

In\nthe case of the commensurate SW solutions the analysis reduces to the\neigenvalue problem of a transfer matrix depending parametrically on the\neigenfrequency. The spectrum of eigenfrequencies and the corresponding\neigenmodes can thereby be determined exactly. The spatial periodicity of a\ncommensurate SW implies that the eigenmodes are of the Bloch form,\ncharacterised by an even number of Floquet multipliers. The spectrum is made up\nof bands that, in general, include a number of transition points corresponding\nto changes in the disposition of the Floquet multipliers.

The\nswitch stability is characterised by a well defined lifetime $\\tau$. We find\nthat $\\tau$ grows exponentially with the mean number $\\Nmean$ of transcription\nfactor molecules involved in the switching. In the regime accessible to direct\nnumerical simulations, the growth law is well characterised by\n$\\tau\\sim\\Nmean{}^{\\alpha}\\exp(b\\Nmean)$, where $\\alpha$ and $b$ are\nparameters. The switch stability is decreased by phenomena that increase the\nnoise in gene expression, such as the production of multiple copies of a\nprotein from a single mRNA transcript (shot noise), and fluctuations in the\nnumber of proteins produced per transcript. However, robustness against\nbiochemical noise can be drastically enhanced by arranging the transcription\nfactor binding domains on the DNA such that competing transcription factors\nmutually exclude each other on the DNA. We also elucidate the origin of the\nenhanced stability of the exclusive switch with respect to that of the general\nswitch: while the kinetic prefactor is roughly the same for both switches, the\n`barrier' for flipping the switch is significantly higher for the exclusive\nswitch than for the general switch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2004 08:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
