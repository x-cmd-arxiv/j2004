The\nunderlying hypotheses for this work are that price promotions are more\neffective when fewer than average competitors do a promotion, and that a\npromotion strategy can be based on past sales data. The first assumption has\nbeen checked by analysing 1467 promotional actions for three products on the\nDutch market (ketchup, mayonnaise and curry sauce) over a 120-week period, both\non an aggregated level and on retailer chain level.\n  The second assumption was tested by analysing past sales data with the\nMinority Game. This revealed that high or low competitor promotional pressure\nfor actual ketchup, mayonnaise, curry sauce and barbecue sauce markets is to\nsome extent predictable up to a forecast of some 10 weeks. Whereas a random\nguess would be right 50% of the time, a single-agent game can predict the\nmarket with a success rate of 56% for a 6 to 9 week forecast. This number is\nthe same for all four mentioned fast moving consumer markets. For a multi-agent\ngame a larger variability in the success rate is obtained, but predictability\ncan be as high as 65%.\n  Contrary to expectation, the actual market does the opposite of what game\ntheory would predict. This points at a systematic oscillation in the market.\nEven though this result is not fully understood, merely observing that this\ntrend is present in the data could lead to exploitable trading benefits. As a\ncheck, random history strings were generated from which the statistical\nvariation in the game prediction was studied. This shows that the odds are\n1:1,000,000 that the observed pattern in the market is based on coincidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2004 09:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the former\ncase the string network does not achieve a scaling regime because of the\ndiminishing rate of string intersections ($D>3$), but this can be avoided in\nthe latter case by considering compact, small extra dimensions, for which there\nis a reduced but still appreciable string intercommuting probability. We note\nthat the velocity components lying in the three expanding dimensions are\nHubble-damped, whereas those in the static extra dimensions are only very\nweakly damped. This leads to the pathological possibility, in principle, that\nstring motion in the three infinite dimensions can come to a halt preventing\nthe strings from intersecting, with the result that scaling is not achieved and\nthe strings irreversibly dominate the early universe. We note criteria by which\nthis can be avoided, notably if the spatial structure of the network becomes\nessentially three-dimensional, as is expected for string networks produced in\nbrane inflation.
