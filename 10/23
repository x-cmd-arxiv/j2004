The compositions and\nstructures of GEMS indicate that they have been processed by exposure to ion-\nizing radiation but details of the actual irradiation environment(s) have\nremained elusive. Here we propose a mechanism and astrophysical site for GEMS\nformation that explains for the first time the following key properties of\nGEMS; they are stoichiometrically enriched in oxygen and systematically deple-\nted in S, Mg, Ca and Fe (relative to solar abundances), most have normal\n(solar) oxygen isotopic compositions, they exhibit a strikingly narrow size\ndistribution (0.1-0.5 $\\mu$m diameter), and some of them contain ``relict''\ncrystals within their glass matrices. We show that these properties are incon-\nsistent with amorphization by particles accelerated by diffusive shock accel-\neration. Instead, we propose that GEMS are formed from crystalline grains that\ncondense in outflows from massive stars in OB associations, are accelerated in\nencounters with frequent supernova shocks inside the associated superbubble,\nand are implanted with atoms from the hot gas in the SB interior. We thus rev-\nerse the usual roles of target and projectile. Rather than being bombarded at\nrest by energetic ions, grains are accelerated and bombarded by a nearly mono-\nvelocity beam of atoms as viewed in their rest frame. Meyer, Drury and Ellison\nhave proposed that galactic cosmic rays originate from ions sputtered from such\naccelerated dust grains. We suggest that GEMS are surviving members of a pop-\nulation of fast grains that constitute the long-sought source material for gal-\nactic cosmic rays. Thus, representatives of the GCR source material may have\nbeen awaiting discovery in cosmic dust labs for the last thirty years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2004 22:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The major and minor radii are 0.38 m\nand 0.25m, respectively. The magnetic field strength is 0.3T and the maximum\nplasma current is up to 140 kA. The electron and ion temperatures are 0.4-0.5\nkeV and 0.1 keV, respectively and the electron density is ~1x1019 m-3. The NPA\ncan be scanned toroidally from q = 74&deg; (cw) to q = 114&deg; (ccw), where q\n= 90&deg; corresponds to the perpendicular sightline. The direction of the\nplasma current is cw. The NPA signals are digitized at every 50 ms. The NPA is\ncalibrated in the energy range of 0.1 keV < E < 8.4 keV. When the IRE occurs,\nit is observed that the plasma current increases by ~ 20% and the loop voltage\ndrops from 0.6 V to-5 V for ~ 0.1 ms. The enhanced charge exchange flux is\nobserved by more than one order of magnitude at ~ 1 keV for this reconnection\nphase. The ion temperature increases by 80 eV at IREs. The angle q dependence\nof increment of Ti shows that DTi (q = 74&deg;) is higher than that for q =\n114&deg;. This observation suggests that an ion is accelerated initially in the\ndirection of magnetic field lines.
