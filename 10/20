In view that the leading theoretical model for pulsar sub-pulse\ndrifting can only interpret one-direction sub-pulse drifting, the observed\n\"bi-drifting\" phenomenon from PSR J0815+09 poses a great challenge to the\npulsar theory. The inner annular gap (IAG), a new type of inner particle\naccelerator, was recently proposed to explain both $\\gamma$-ray and radio\nemission from pulsars. Here we show that the coexistence of the IAG and the\nconventional inner core gap (ICG) offers a natural interpretation to the\nbi-drifting phenomenon.

It is thought that the conducting channels, with diameters less\nthan or of the order of a micrometre, are composed of smaller nanofilaments,\nwith diameters of the order of a nanometre. In the present paper a possible\nexplanation is given of measurements which show that the average resistance of\nnon-superconducting channels through films increases with film thickness more\nslowly than linearly. This result is interpreted in terms of how the Bose\ncondensation temperatures of bosons in arrays of nanofilaments depend on the\nlength and numbers of filaments, and examples are given of parameters of the\narrays which could explain the data. The dispersion for the bosons is assumed\nto consist of a sum of linear and quadratic terms, which is an approximate type\nof dispersion reported for Cooper pairs. In order to fit the data with the\nmodel used, it is necessary to suppose that values of superconducting Tc for\nchannels composed of large numbers of filaments are only slightly above room\ntemperature. It is argued that larger Tc's reported in 1989 when currents of\n0.5 A are passed through channels may arise because (a) currents concentrate in\na subchannel of smaller width than the original channel, and (b)\ncurrent-current interactions draw the filaments of the subchannel sufficiently\nclose together to increase the transverse bandwidth and Tc in the model by the\nrequired amount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2004 13:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\ntransition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the\npotential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay.

At higher energies the\ndominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by\nthe emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy\nE=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration.

From radial profiles of E,\nelectron density ne and temperature Te, profiles for Zeff can be reconstructed.\nHowever, their interpretation is difficult outside the plasma centre, because\nof various uncertainties in E, ne and Te at the edge, which render the radial\nmatching of the different profiles problematic.
