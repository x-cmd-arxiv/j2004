The main goal is to study\nthe origin of the X-ray spectral differences usually observed between\nradio-loud and radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs. To this end, a comparison sample of 53 RQ\nAGNs has been also extracted from the same XBSS sample and studied together\nwith the sample of RL AGNs. We have focused the analysis on the distribution of\nthe X-ray spectral indices of the power-law component that models the large\nmajority of the spectra in both samples. We find that the mean X-ray energy\nspectral index is very similar in the 2 samples and close to alpha_X~1.\nHowever, the intrinsic distribution of the spectral indices is significantly\nbroader in the sample of RL AGNs. In order to investigate the origin of this\ndifference, we have divided the RL AGNs into blazars and ``non-blazars'', on\nthe basis of the available optical and radio information. We find strong\nevidence that the broad distribution observed in the RL AGN sample is mainly\ndue to the presence of the blazars. Furthermore, within the blazar class we\nhave found a link between the X-ray spectral index and the value of the\nradio-to-X-ray spectral index suggesting that the observed X-ray emission is\ndirectly connected to the emission of the relativistic jet. This trend is not\nobserved among the ``non-blazars'' RL AGNs. This favours the hypothesis that,\nin these latter sources, the X-ray emission is not significantly influenced by\nthe jet emission and it has probably an origin similar to the RQ AGNs. Overall,\nthe results presented here indicate that the observed distribution of the X-ray\nspectral indices in a given sample of RL AGNs is strongly dependent on the\namount of relativistic beaming present in the selected sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2004 10:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The formation of islands can be ascribed to a partial relaxation\nof adsorbate material which affects the diffusion barriers for adsorbate\nparticles. The dependence of island size and density on misfit, temperature and\nparticle flux is in good qualitative agreement with metal-organic vapor phase\nepitaxy experiments.

It also takes as input a\nprescribed movement of the boundary mesh. It computes as output updated\npositions of the vertices of the volume mesh. The first step of the algorithm\nis to determine from the initial mesh a set of local weights for each interior\nvertex that describes each interior vertex in terms of the positions of its\nneighbors. These weights are computed using a finite element stiffness matrix.\nAfter a boundary transformation is applied, a linear system of equations based\nupon the weights is solved to determine the final positions of the interior\nvertices.

The vortex appears with a deep\ndensity-cavity, plasma hole, in its center, and is identified as a dissipative\nvortex in viscous fluids (Burgers vortex) [1]. The kinematic viscosity\nestimated from the vorticity profile and the ion flow field is 4 orders of\nmagnitude higher than the classical value, which may be attributable to\ninsufficiency of the Debye shielding or the breaking of quasi-neutrality. Here\nwe present the results of potential measurements and the evaluation of\nquasi-neutrality breaking. It is revealed that the potential has a bell-shaped\naxisymmetric structure localized inside the core region, in which its maximum\nvalue exceeds 5 Te. Using Poisson's equation, degree of quasi-neutrality\nbreaking is evaluated, which shows 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of\nusual laboratory plasma. The strong electric field produced by this\nquasi-neutrality breaking drives the supersonic rotation of the plasma hole. It\nshould be mentioned that the degree of quasi-neutrality breaking in the ambient\nregion of the plasma hole is comparable to that of usual laboratory plasma.\nHence the plasma hole can be considered as the structure of a nonneutral core\nsurrounded by a quasi-neutral plasma.

This method makes use of the\nmultipole approximation of the Z dispersion function, previously published, and\nvalid for the entire range. A careful analysis of the solutions spectra of this\nkind of polynomial equation permits us to calculate easily the growth rate of\nthe drift instability for the ion-dust and dust acoustic mode. The value of the\nparallel to magnetic field wavelength for which the instability reaches the\nmaximal value is carefully localized and discussed. The unstable dust-ion and\ndust acoustic mode are discriminated and analyzed in function of the density\ngradient, Te/Ti - ratio, and dust grain radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2004 14:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2004 16:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a 40 $\\mu$m diameter disk, made out of\neither quartz or calcite, kept parallel to a Barium Titanate plate at $d\\simeq\n100$ nm, the maximum torque (at $\\theta={\\pi\\over 4}$) is of the order of\n$\\simeq 10^{-19}$ N$\\cdot$m.
