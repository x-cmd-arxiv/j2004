The\nfluid's long-distance behavior is studied using renormalization-group (RG)\nmethods, as begun by Forster, Nelson, and Stephen [Phys. Rev. A 16, 732\n(1977)]. With friction, which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers, one expects\na stationary inverse energy cascade for strong enough stirring. While such\ndeveloped turbulence is beyond the quantitative reach of perturbation theory, a\ncombination of exact and perturbative results suggests a coherent picture of\nthe inverse cascade. The zero-friction fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is\nderived from a generalized time-reversal symmetry and implies zero anomalous\ndimension for the velocity even when friction is present. Thus the Kolmogorov\nscaling of the inverse cascade cannot be explained by any RG fixed point. The\nbeta function for the dimensionless coupling ghat is computed through two\nloops; the ghat^3 term is positive, as already known, but the ghat^5 term is\nnegative. An ideal cascade requires a linear beta function for large ghat,\nconsistent with a Pad\\'e approximant to the Borel transform. The conjecture\nthat the Kolmogorov spectrum arises from an RG flow through large ghat is\ncompatible with other results, but the accurate k^{-5/3} scaling is not\nexplained and the Kolmogorov constant is not estimated. The lack of scale\ninvariance should produce intermittency in high-order structure functions, as\nobserved in some but not all numerical simulations of the inverse cascade. When\nanalogous RG methods are applied to the one-dimensional Burgers equation using\nan FDT-preserving dimensional continuation, equipartition is obtained instead\nof a cascade--in agreement with simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Oct 2004 04:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2005 18:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

In order to have a common measure of\npellet ablation, the regression study has been performed as an international\ncooperation activity, obtaining \"IPAD\" (International Pellet Ablation Database)\n>. However, these are an empirical scaling, and the mechanism of pellet\nablation still remains to be studied. According to the code calculations based\non a typical pellet ablation model (e. g., so-called the neutral gas shielding\nmodel), it is understood that the penetration depth into plasma is always quite\nsensitive to the pellet size. If the pellet size is too large, the pellet\npasses through the plasma, and if it is too small, it is trapped at the plasma\nsurface. Also, an effective or suitable range of the pellet size for a certain\nplasma is generally very narrow, and this range largely varies depending on\neach plasma size and plasma parameters. Thus, the precise controllability of\nthe pellet size, especially the size controllability with continuously variable\nsystem will be quite effective in order to carry out the detailed studies on\npellet ablation and associated phenomena. A pellet injector of new type with\nprecisely and continuously controllable system of pellet size is being\ndeveloped. This has a unique mechanics and structure of producing a frozen\npellet in extremely low temperature region. In the device presently developed\nin this research, we will precisely adjust the length of the cylindrical pellet\n($\\Phi$ 1.0mm) from 0.5 to 3 mm by using the special \"length restriction\nrod\".&#12288;&#12288;\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2004 20:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
