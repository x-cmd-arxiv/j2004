While researchers have identified many uses of spatial\nconjunction, its precise expressive power compared to traditional logical\nconstructs was not previously known. In this paper we establish the expressive\npower of spatial conjunction. We construct an embedding from first-order logic\nwith spatial conjunction into second-order logic, and more surprisingly, an\nembedding from full second order logic into first-order logic with spatial\nconjunction. These embeddings show that the satisfiability of formulas in\nfirst-order logic with spatial conjunction is equivalent to the satisfiability\nof formulas in second-order logic. These results explain the great expressive\npower of spatial conjunction and can be used to show that adding unrestricted\nspatial conjunction to a decidable logic leads to an undecidable logic. As one\nexample, we show that adding unrestricted spatial conjunction to two-variable\nlogic leads to undecidability. On the side of decidability, the embedding into\nsecond-order logic immediately implies the decidability of first-order logic\nwith a form of spatial conjunction over trees. The embedding into spatial\nconjunction also has useful consequences: because a restricted form of spatial\nconjunction in two-variable logic preserves decidability, we obtain that a\ncorrespondingly restricted form of second-order quantification in two-variable\nlogic is decidable. The resulting language generalizes the first-order theory\nof boolean algebra over sets and is useful in reasoning about the contents of\ndata structures in object-oriented languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2004 15:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This approach\nto QCD vacuum structure does not rely on any proposed picture of QCD vacuum but\nrather attempts to characterize this structure in a model-independent manner,\nso that a coherent physical picture of the vacuum can emerge when such unbiased\nnumerical information accumulates to a sufficient degree. An important part of\nthis program is to develop a set of suitable quantitative characteristics\ndescribing the space-time structure in a meaningful and physically relevant\nmanner. One of the basic pertinent issues here is whether QCD vacuum dynamics\ncan be understood in terms of localized vacuum objects, or whether such objects\nbehave as inherently global entities.

They are related to two different types of superradiant\nscattering observed in recent experiments. The first one corresponds to the\namplification of matter-waves due to Raman superradiant scattering from a\ncigar-shaped BE condensate, when the recoiled and the condensed atoms are in\ndifferent internal states. The main mechanism is stimulated Raman scattering in\ntwo-level atoms, which occurs in a superradiant way. Our second model is\nrelated to the superradiant Rayleigh scattering from a cigar-shaped BE\ncondensate. This again leads to a matter-waves amplification but now with the\nrecoiled atoms in the same state as the atoms in the condensate. Here the\nrecoiling atoms are able to interfere with the condensate at rest to form a\nmatter-wave grating (interference fringes) which is observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 2004 19:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 19:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

We find that\n(i) the mean concentration of the encapsidated polyelectrolyte material depends\non the surface charge density, the radius of the capsid, and the linear charge\ndensity of the polymer but neither on the salt concentration or the Kuhn\nlength, (ii) the total charge of the capsid interior is equal but opposite to\nthat of the empty capsid, a form of charge reversal. Unlike natural viruses,\nsynthetic viruses are predicted not to be under an osmotic swelling pressure.\nThe design condition that self-assembly only produces filled capsids is shown\nto coincide with the condition that the capsid surface charge exceeds the\ndesorption threshold of polymer surface adsorption.
