The main\ndifference is due to the Dark Matter coupling to interacting (or even\nfreely-propagating) species.

In many cases, it is the\nso-called electric field effect that allows one to vary the carrier\nconcentration in a semiconductor device and, consequently, change an electric\ncurrent through it. As the semiconductor industry is nearing the limits of\nperformance improvements for the current technologies dominated by silicon,\nthere is a constant search for new, non-traditional materials whose properties\ncan be controlled by electric field. Most notable examples of such materials\ndeveloped recently are organic conductors [1], oxides near a superconducting or\nmagnetic phase transition [2] and carbon nanotubes [3-5]. Here, we describe\nanother system of this kind - thin monocrystalline films of graphite - which\nexhibits a pronounced electric field effect, such that carriers in the\nconductive channel can be turned into either electrons or holes. The films\nremain metallic, continuous and of high quality down to a few atomic layers in\nthickness. The demonstrated ease of preparing such films of nearly macroscopic\nsizes and of their processing by standard microfabrication techniques, combined\nwith submicron-scale ballistic transport even at room temperature, offer a new\ntwo-dimensional system controllable by electric-field doping and provide a\nrealistic promise of device applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2004 12:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Kaye, Kossak, and Kotlarski introduced the notion of arithmetic\nsaturation and argued that recursive saturation might not be as rigid as first\nassumed.\n  In this thesis we give further examples of variations of recursive\nsaturation, all of which are connected with expandability properties similar to\nresplendence. However, the expandability properties are stronger than\nresplendence and implies, in one way or another, that the expansion not only\nsatisfies a theory, but also omits a type. We conjecture that a special version\nof this expandability is in fact equivalent to arithmetic saturation. We prove\nthat another of these properties is equivalent to \\beta-saturation. We also\nintroduce a variant on recursive saturation which makes sense in the context of\na standard predicate, and which is equivalent to a certain amount of ordinary\nsaturation.\n  The theory of all models which omit a certain type p(x) is also investigated.\nWe define a proof system, which proves a sentence if and only if it is true in\nall models omitting the type p(x). The complexity of such proof systems are\ndiscussed and some explicit examples of theories and types with high\ncomplexity, in a special sense, are given.\n  We end the thesis by a small comment on Scott's problem. We prove that, under\nthe assumption of Martin's axiom, every Scott set of cardinality <2^{\\aleph_0}\nclosed under arithmetic comprehension which has the countable chain condition\nis the standard system of some model of PA. However, we do not know if there\nexists any such uncountable Scott sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2004 11:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In addition, fallout samples were collected in the city of Zadar. 90Sr\nactivity concentrations are in good correlation with the fallout activity, the\ncoefficient of correlation being 0.72. After the nuclear moratorium on\natmospheric nuclear bomb tests in 1960s, 90Sr activity concentrations in sea\nwater exponentially dropped from 14.8 +/- 2.4 Bq/m3 in 1963 to 2.0 +/- 0.3\nBq/m3 in 2003.

As in physical oceanography 90Sr can be used as effective\nradioactive tracer of water mass transport, this value also reflects the upper\nlimit for turnover time of the Adriatic sea water. The turnover time of 3.4\nyears for the Adriatic sea water is in reasonable agreement with the value\nwhich was estimated, by studying water flows through the Strait of Otranto, to\nbe on the order of 1 year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2004 15:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The binding of RNA fragments involving other\nsequences than the intended target is problematic because it adds a \"chemical\nbackground\" to the signal, which is not related to the expression degree of the\ntarget gene. The paper presents a molecular signature of specific and non\nspecific hybridization with potential consequences for gene expression\nanalysis. We analyzed the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch\n(MM) probes of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and non\nspecific hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different\nrelations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle base of\nthe PMs, namely a triplet- (C>G=T>A>0) and a duplet-like (C=T>0>G=A) pattern of\nthe PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of specific and non specific\nRNA fragments, respectively. The systematic behaviour of the intensity\ndifference can be rationalized on the level of base pairings of DNA/RNA\noligonucleotide duplexes in the middle of the probe sequence. Non-specific\nbinding is characterized by the reversal of the central Watson Crick (WC)\npairing for each PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the\ncombination of a WC and a self complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes,\nrespectively. The intensity of complementary MM introduces a systematic source\nof variation which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the\nMM intensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2004 09:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2005 15:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
