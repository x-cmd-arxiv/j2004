It is shown that the noisy KS equation\nis in the same universality class as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in\nthe sense that they have scale invariant solutions with the same scaling\nexponents in the long-wavelength limit. The RG analysis reveals that the RG\nflow for the parameters of the noisy KS equation rapidly approach the KPZ fixed\npoint with increasing the strength of the noise. This is supplemented by the\nnumerical simulations of the KS equation with a stochastic noise, in which the\nscaling behavior of the KPZ equation can be easily observed even in the\nmoderate system size and time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2004 23:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2004 07:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The basic\nelectronic structure of the cuprates is reviewed, emphasizing the physics of\nstrong correlation and establishing the model of a doped Mott insulator as a\nstarting point. A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region\nof the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where\nthe behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating\nvalence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data.\nThe importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the\ntransition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal\nexcitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of\nprojected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to\nimplement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of\npredictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper\ndeals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the\nRVB idea on a more formal footing.

Any pair of bodies are attracting not due to an\nexchange with its own gravitons, but due to a pressure of external gravitons of\nthis background. A graviton pairing is necessary to obtain classical gravity.\nAny divergencies are not possible in such the model because of natural smooth\ncut-offs of the graviton spectrum from both sides. Some cosmological\nconsequences of this scheme are discussed, too. Also it is shown here that the\nmain conjecture of this approach may be verified at present on the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2004 06:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nparticular, the classical Hurwitz problem about enumeration of topologically\ndistinct ramified coverings of the sphere with prescribed ramification type\nreduces to the study of geometry and topology of these spaces. The cohomology\nrings of such spaces are complicated even in the simplest cases of rational\ncurves and functions. However, the cohomology classes that are the most\nimportant from the point of view of applications (namely, the classes\nPoincar\\'e dual to the strata of functions with given singularities) can be\nexpressed in terms of relatively simple ``basic'' classes (which are, in a\nsense, tautological). The aim of the present paper is to identify these basic\nclasses, to describe relations among them, and to find expressions for the\nstrata in terms of these classes. Our approach is based on R. Thom's theory of\nuniversal polynomials of singularities, which has been extended to the case of\nmultisingularities by the first author.

Instead of being\nsubjected to a rising potential between source and accelerating grid, electrons\nare now accelerated in less than one excitation mean-free-path by an extra\ngrid, and then drift towards the second grid across a large equipotential\nregion. In this arrangement one must face the difficulty that the space\npotential between the grids is strongly modified by space charges. A recent\nanalysis of this experiment with mercury showed that there is a particular form\nof discharge that generates and sustains the ideal design dynamically. The\ninevitable variations of potential inside the intergrid volume are then\nconfined within a narrow sheath, a free double layer, joining two field-free\nplasma regions. The position of the double layer can be controlled so as to\noptimize the experiment. In the present paper, those phenomena are studied\ntheoretically in steady-state conditions. The essence of the method is to\nspecify velocity distributions for electrons and ions and use them to solve the\nPoisson equation. Vortex-type functions are used for trapped particles and\nmono-energetic beams for free particles. The model explains the change of\nposition of the double layer and provides a natural explanation of a threshold\ncondition for its amplitude that governs the transition between two critical\nconfigurations, in accordance with experiment. Stability and minimum\nfield-energy considerations lead to a unique solution in a four-dimensional\nparameter space where the Langmuir ratio is equal to one. The method is\nadaptable to other experiments on double layer formation under discharge\nconditions and correctly predicts the values of several plasma parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2004 14:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When attention is directed towards the stimulus eliciting the\nstrongest response (the preferred stimulus), the response to the pair is\nincreased, whereas the response decreases when attention is directed to the\nother stimulus (the poor stimulus). These experimental results were reproduced\nin a model of a V4 neuron under the assumption that attention modulates the\nactivity of local interneuron networks. The V4 model neuron received\nstimulus-specific asynchronous excitation from V2 and synchronous inhibitory\ninputs from two local interneuron networks in V4. Each interneuron network was\ndriven by stimulus-specific excitatory inputs from V2 and was modulated by a\nprojection from the frontal eye fields. Stimulus competition was present\nbecause of a delay in arrival time of synchronous volleys from each interneuron\nnetwork. For small delays, the firing rate was close to the rate elicited by\nthe preferred stimulus alone, whereas for larger delays it approached the\nfiring rate of the poor stimulus. When either stimulus was presented alone the\nneuron's response was not altered by the change in delay. The model suggests\nthat top-down attention biases the competition between V2 columns for control\nof V4 neurons by changing the relative timing of inhibition rather than by\nchanges in the degree of synchrony of interneuron networks.
