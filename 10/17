We calculate the full coupling equations for all six possible CMB\npower spectra, relating the observed pseudo-Cl's to the underlying all-sky\nCl's, and test the reconstruction on both full-sky and cut-sky simulated CMB\ndata sets. In particular we consider the reconstruction of the Cl from upcoming\nground-based polarization experiments covering areas of a few hundred sq.\ndegrees and find that the method is fast, unbiased and performs well over a\nwide range of multipoles from l=2 to l=2500. We then calculate the full\ncovariance matrix between the modes of the pseudo-temperature and polarization\npower spectra, assuming that the underlying CMB fields are Gaussian randomly\ndistributed. The complexity of the covariance matrix prohibits its rapid\ncalculation, required for parameter estimation. Hence we present an\napproximation for the covariance matrix in terms of convolutions of the\nunderlying power spectra. The coupling matrices in these expressions can be\nestimated by fitting to numerical simulations, circumventing direct and slow\ncalculation, and further, inaccurate analytic approximations. We show that\nthese coupling matrices are mostly independent of cosmology, and that the full\ncovariance matrix for all six pseudo-Cl power spectra can be quickly and\naccurately calculated for any given cosmological model using this method. We\ncompare these semi-analytic covariance matrices against simulations and find\ngood agreement, the accuracy of which depends mainly on survey area and the\nrange of cosmological parameters considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 2004 14:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2005 16:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
