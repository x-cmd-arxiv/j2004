Let $T$ be a triangle formed by the origin and two points\nsampled independently from the hitting distribution on the sphere of radius\n$an$ for a constant $0<a<1$. Then when $a<1/4$, if the geodesics are suitably\nchosen, with high probability $T$ is $\\delta$-thin for some $\\delta>0$, whereas\nit is always O(n)-thick when $a>1/4$. We also show that the hitting\ndistribution of the sphere of radius $an$ is asymptotically singular with\nrespect to the uniform distribution. Finally, we prove that the critical\nbehavior of this Gromov-like hyperbolicity constant persists if the two\nendpoints are sampled from the uniform measure on the sphere of radius $an$.\nHowever, in this case, the critical radius is $a=1-\\log2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2004 15:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 17:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 May 2006 09:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The self-consistent method is used\nto derive the effective scattering function of a single bubble embedded in the\narrays, incorporating all multiple scattering processes. For the line case, an\nexact result is derived. In the plane array situation, only an approximate\nanalytic result is possible. Numerical computations have been carried out to\nshow the multiple scattering effects on wave scattering. It is shown that\ndepending on the distance between bubbles the resonance peak of a single bubble\ncan either be broadened or narrowed due to multiple scattering and it shows an\noscillatory behavior as the distance changes. Meanwhile, the peak scattering\namplitude is also be either enhanced or reduced. The previously predicted\nstrong enhancement, however, is not evident. For plane arrays, the usual\nresonant scattering of a single bubble in absence of other bubbles can be\nsuppressed by multiple scattering when the distance between bubbles is\nsufficiently small. As the distance increases, the resonant scattering starts\nto appear, and the resonance peak position is alternately shifted towards\nhigher and lower values. Moreover, it is predicted that wave propagation\nthrough a plane bubble array can be significantly inhibited in a range of\nfrequencies slightly higher than the natural frequency of a single bubble,\npossibly a useful feature for noise screening. The ambiguities in the previous\nresults are pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2004 01:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Elucidating such networks is crucial for the understanding\nof normal cell physiology as well as for the dissection of complex pathologic\nphenotypes. Existing methods for such \"reverse engineering\" of genetic networks\nfrom microarray expression data have been successful only in prokaryotes (E.\ncoli) and lower eukaryotes (S. cerevisiae) with relatively simple genomes.\nAdditionally, they have mostly attempted to reconstruct average properties\nabout the network connectivity without capturing the highly conditional nature\nof the interactions. In this paper we extend the ARACNE algorithm, which we\nrecently introduced and successfully applied to the reconstruction of\nwhole-genome transcriptional networks from mammalian cells, precisely to link\nthe existence of specific network structures to the expression or lack thereof\nof specific regulator genes. This is accomplished by analyzing thousands of\nalternative network topologies generated by constraining the data set on the\npresence or absence of putative regulator genes. By considering interactions\nthat are consistently supported across several such constraints, we identify\nmany transcriptional interactions that would not have been detectable by the\noriginal method. By selecting genes that produce statistically significant\nchanges in network topology, we identify novel candidate regulator genes.\nFurther analysis shows that transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and\nother gene families known to effect biochemical interactions, are significantly\noverrepresented among the set of candidate regulator genes identified in\nsilico, indirectly supporting the validity of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2004 22:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
