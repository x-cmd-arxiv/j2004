We found\nsinusoidal radial velocity variations of the companion star with a\nsemi-amplitude of 99.1+-3.1 km s^-1 modulated on a period of 9.006+-0.007 days,\nconsistent with the orbital period found before for this source, and a systemic\nvelocity of 44.4+-2.4 km s^-1. Due to X-ray irradiation the centre-of-light\nmeasured by the absorption lines from the companion star is likely shifted with\nrespect to the centre-of-mass. We try to correct for this using the so-called\nK-correction. Conservatively applying the maximum correction possible and using\nthe previously measured rotational velocity of the companion star, we find a\nlower limit to the mass of the compact object in 2S 0921-630 of M_X sin^3 i >\n1.90+-0.25 Msun (1 sigma errors). The inclination in this system is well\nconstrained since partial eclipses have been observed in X-rays and optical\nbands. For inclinations between 60< i<90 degrees we find\n1.90+-0.25<M_X<2.9+-0.4 Msun. However, using this maximum K-correction we find\nthat the ratio between the mass of the companion star and that of the compact\nobject, q, is 1.32+-0.37 implying super-Eddington mass transfer rates; however,\nevidence for that has not been found in 2S 0921-630. We conclude that the\ncompact object in 2S 0921-630 is either a (massive) neutron star or a low-mass\nblack hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2004 16:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Thus, their appearance on\nthe cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them\nuniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest\nthings whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest\nobjects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial\nequilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to\ndetermine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 10^14 to 10^15\nsolar masses, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with\nthe mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of\nstructure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models.\nSecond, clusters are essentially ``closed boxes'' that retain all their gaseous\nmatter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so\ndeep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of\ninformation about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the\nefficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the\nresulting feedback processes on galaxy formation.

The Rashba coupling, generated by\nspin-orbit interaction in wells lacking bulk inversion symmetry, introduces a\ndegeneracy of Zeeman-split Landau levels at certain magnetic fields. This\ndegeneracy, if occuring at the Fermi energy, will induce a resonance in the\nspin Hall conductance below a characteristic temperature of order of the Zeeman\nenergy. At very low temperatures, the spin Hall current is highly non-ohmic.\nThe Dresselhaus coupling due to the lack of structure inversion symmetry\npartially or completely suppresses the spin Hall resonance. The condition for\nthe resonant spin Hall conductance in the presence of both Rashba and\nDresselhaus couplings is derived using a perturbation method. In the presence\nof disorder, we argue that the resonant spin Hall conductance occurs when the\ntwo Zeeman split extended states near the Fermi level becomes degenerate due to\nthe Rashba coupling and that the the quantized charge Hall conductance changes\nby 2e^2/h instead of e^2/h as the magnetic field changes through the resonant\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 07:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The TFD approach\nstarts by duplicating the system's degrees of freedom, defining an auxiliary\n(tilde) string. In order to lead the system to finite temperature a Bogoliubov\ntransformation is implemented.

In\nthis paper, we address the problem raised by the interference in the plates and\nbetween the plates, which affects the measurement by giving rise to\nbirefringence. We demonstrate that wedged plates provide a convenient and\nefficient way to avoid this interference. We have implemented and characterized\ndevices with 4 and 6 wedged plates at Brewster incidence which have led to a\ndecisive improvement of the signal to noise ratio in our ongoing Parity\nViolation measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 13:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 11:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 06:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2004 19:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2005 20:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

S_D is the\ndynamic system described by the Dirac equation. For investigation of S_D and\nconstruction of S_{Dcl} one uses a new dynamic method: dynamic disquantization.\nThis relativistic purely dynamic procedure does not use principles of quantum\nmechanics. The obtained classical analog S_{Dcl} is described by a system of\nordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant $\\hbar$ as a\nparameter. Dynamic equations for S_{Dcl} are determined by the Dirac equation\nuniquely. The dynamic system S_{Dcl} has ten degrees of freedom and cannot be a\npointlike particle, because it has an internal structure. There are two ways of\ninterpretation of the dynamic system S_{Dcl}: (1) dynamical interpretation and\n(2) geometrical interpretation. In the dynamical interpretation the classical\nDirac particle S_{Dcl} is a two-particle structure (special case of a\nrelativistic rotator). It explains freely such properties of S_D as spin and\nmagnetic moment, which are strange for pointlike structure. In the geometrical\ninterpretation the world tube of S_{Dcl} is a ''two-dimensional broken band'',\nconsisting of similar segments. These segments are parallelograms (or\ntriangles), but not the straight line segments as in the case of a\nstructureless particle. Geometrical interpretation of the classical Dirac\nparticle S_{Dcl} generates a new approach to the elementary particle theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 13:30:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2004 12:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
