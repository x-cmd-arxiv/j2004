We reproduce the general\nobservational characteristics of superbursts, including burst fluences,\nrecurrence times, and the absence of superbursts on stars with accretion rates\nbelow 10% of the Eddington limit. By comparing our results with observations,\nwe are able to set constraints on neutron star parameters such as the stellar\nradius and neutrino cooling mechanism in the core. Specifically, we find that\naccreting neutron stars with ordered crusts and highly efficient neutrino\nemission in their cores (due to direct URCA or pionic reactions, for example)\nproduce extremely energetic (> 10^44 ergs) superbursts which are inconsistent\nwith observations, in agreement with previous investigations. Also, because of\npycnonuclear burning of carbon, they do not have superbursts in the range of\naccretion rates at which superbursts are actually observed unless the crust is\nvery impure. Stars with less efficient neutrino emission (due to modified URCA\nreactions, for example) produce bursts that agree better with observations.\nStars with highly inefficient neutrino emission in their cores produce bursts\nthat agree best with observations. All systems that accrete primarily hydrogen\nand in which superbursts are observed show evidence of H- and He-burning\ndelayed mixed bursts. We speculate that delayed mixed bursts provide sufficient\namounts of carbon fuel for superbursts and are thus a prerequisite for having\nsuperbursts. We compare our global stability analysis to approximate one-zone\ncriteria used by other authors and identify a particular set of approximations\nthat give accurate results for most choices of parameters.

We briefly discuss the history\nof antimatter research and focus on the technologies that must be developed to\nallow a future use of controlled, condensed antihydrogen for propulsion\npurposes. We emphasize that a dedicated antiproton source (the main barrier to\ncopious antihydrogen production) must be built in the US, perhaps as a joint\nNASA/DOE/NIH project.

By identifying spatial domains\nas connected patches of the exactly computable ground states of the system we\ndemonstrate that the growing length scale ${\\cal L}(t)$ is the characteristic\nsize of thermally fluctuating clusters around ``typical'' long-lived\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2004 14:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Such a construction could be viewed as a classical model of an\nelementary particle balanced by its own forces without support by an external\nagent. One choice is the Minkowski interior that goes back to the old Vilenkin\nand Fomin's idea who claimed that in this case the bare delta-like stresses at\nthe horizon vanish if the RN metric is extremal. However, the relevant entity\nhere is the integral of these stresses over the proper distance which is\ninfinite in the extremal case. As a result of the competition of these two\nfactors, the Lanczos tensor does not vanish and the extremal RN cannot be glued\nto the Minkowski metric smoothly, so the elementary-particle model as a ball\nempty inside fails. We examine the alternative possibility for the extremal RN\nmetric - gluing to the Bertotti-Robinson (BR) metric. For a surface placed\noutside the horizon there always exist bare stresses but their amplitude goes\nto zero as the radius of the shell approaches that of the horizon. This limit\nrealizes the Wheeler idea of \"mass without mass\" and \"charge without charge\".\nWe generalize the model to the extremal Kerr-Newman metric glued to the\nrotating analog of the BR metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2004 17:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2004 09:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\nstart this series of lectures with a general review of Random Matrix Theory and\nthe statistical theory of spectra. An elementary introduction of the\nsupersymmetric method in Random Matrix Theory is given in the second and third\nlecture. We will show that a Random Matrix Theory can be rewritten as an\nintegral over a supermanifold. This integral will be worked out for the\nGaussian Unitary Ensemble that describes systems with broken time reversal\ninvariance. We especially emphasize the role of symmetries. As a second example\nof the application of the supersymemtric method we discuss the calculation of\nthe microscopic spectral density of the QCD Dirac operator. which is known to\nbe given by chiral Random Matrix Theory. Also in this case we use symmetry\nconsiderations to rewrite the generating function for the resolvent as an\nintegral over a supermanifold.

It was motivated by the needs of\nsolid state physics, as a partial (nongeneric) case of Hamiltonian foliations\nof Fermi surfaces with multivalued Hamiltonian function. The unexpected\ndiscoveries of their topological properties that were made in 1980s and 1990s\nhave finally led to nontrivial physical conclusions along the lines of the\nso-called geometric strong magnetic field limit. A very fruitful new point of\nview comes from the reformulation of that problem in terms of quasiperiodic\nfunctions and an extension to higher dimensions made in 1999. One may say that,\nfor single crystal normal metals put in a magnetic field, the semiclassical\ntrajectories of electrons in the space of quasimomenta are exactly the level\nlines of the quasiperiodic function with three quasiperiods that is the\ndispersion relation restricted to a plane orthogonal to the magnetic field.\nGeneral studies of the topological properties of levels of quasiperiodic\nfunctions on the plane with any number of quasiperiods were started in 1999\nwhen certain ideas were formulated for the case of four quasiperiods. The last\nsection of this work contains a complete proof of these results.

We revealed this \"two-stream\" evolutionary pattern by the analysis\nof mutations in 2nd versus 3rd codon positions but not by the routinely used\nratio of amino acid replacements (R) versus silent substitutions (S), i.e. the\n'2nd vs. 3rd' metric proved to be more resolving than the traditional 'R vs. S'\none for distinguishing neutrally evolving future pseudogenes from their\nfunctional counterparts controlled by negative selection.\n  In gene databases for large genomes, hundreds of future pseudogenes are\nannotated as functional genes because they do look like intact and valuable by\nstandard criteria, including even active transcription and translation.\nApparently, these \"pseudogenes-to-be\" over-cloud and mimic those very\ninfrequent gene duplicates with increased sequence evolution rates driven by\npositive selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2004 22:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The form of the numbers in R_{n} is based on the infinite hierarchy of\n2n figure outputs from measurements of any physical quantity with an infinite\nrange (distance, energy, etc.). A space and time based on these numbers is\ndescribed. It corresponds to an infinite sequence of spherical scale sections\nR_{n,e} (e an integer). Each section has the same number of points but the size\nincreases exponentially with increasing e. The sections converge towards an\norigin which is a space singularity. Iteration of an order preserving\ntransformation, F_{<} or its inverse shows exponential expansion or contraction\nof the space with the origin as a source or sink of space points. The\nsuitability of R_{n} space as a framework for inflationary cosmology is based\non a constant iteration rate for F_{<} and time dependent e and n=n(t). At t=0\nall space is restricted to a region of scale sections R_{n_{0},e} with n_{0}\n(small) and e\\leq e_{0} (negative).

This is needed if R_{n_{I},0} space is\nto be similar to the usual R space. Hubble expansion and the redshift are\naccounted for by a continuing slow increase in n.
