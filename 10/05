We compare the results of (a) fitting\nstellar population synthesis models to broad band colors from SDSS and 2MASS,\n(b) the analysis of spectroscopic features of SDSS galaxies (Kauffmann et al.\n2003), and, (c) a simple dynamical mass estimate based on SDSS velocity\ndispersions and effective radii. Knowing that all three methods can have\nsignificant biases, a comparison can help to establish their (relative)\nreliability. In this way, one can also probe the quality of the observationally\ncheap broadband color mass estimators for galaxies at higher redshift.\nGenerally, masses based on broad-band colors and spectroscopic features agree\nreasonably well, with a rms scatter of only ~ 0.25 dex over almost 4 decades in\nmass. However, as may be expected, systematic differences do exist and have an\namplitude of ~ 0.15 dex, corrleting with Halpha emission strength.\nInterestingly, masses from broad-band color fitting are in better agreement\nwith dynamical masses than masses based on the analysis of spectroscopic\nfeatures. In addition, the differences between the latter and the dynamical\nmasses correlate with Halpha equivalent width, while this much less the case\nfor the broad-band masses. We conclude that broad band color mass estimators,\nprovided they are based on a large enough wavelength coverage and use an\nappropriate range of ages, metallicities and dust extinctions, can yield fairly\nreliable stellar masses for galaxies. This is a very encouraging result as such\nmass estimates are very likely the only ones available at significant redshifts\nfor some time to come.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2004 19:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Certain components of the new two-form fields\ndirectly provide canonical momenta for spatial components of all Cartan\nvariables, whereas the remaining ones act as Lagrange multipliers for a large\nnumber of constraints, some of which have been proposed already in different,\nless radical approaches. The time-like components of the Cartan variables play\nthat role for the Lorentz constraints and others associated to the vierbein\nfields.

The key role of the four-gluon interaction is determined by the fact\nthat this interaction survivies when all the gluon momenta involved go to zero,\nwhile the three-gluon vertex vanishes in this limit.

The bi-gaussian distribution is interesting for\nstudying the possibility of using electron cooling in RHIC. Experiments and\ncomputer studies indicate that in the presence of electron cooling, the beam\ndistribution changes so that it developes a strong core and a long tail which\nis not described well by a gaussian, but may be better described by a\nbi-gaussian. Being able to compute the effects of intrabeam scattering for a\nbi-gaussian distribution would be useful in computing the effects of electron\ncooling, which depend critically on the details of the intrabeam scattering.\nThe calculation is done using the reformulation of intrabeam scattering theory\ngiven in [1] based on the treatments given by A. Piwinski [2] and J. Bjorken\nand S.K. Mtingwa [3]. The bi-gaussian distribution is defined below as the sum\nof two gaussians in the particle coordinates $x,y,s,p_x,p_y,p_s$. The gaussian\nwith the smaller dimensions produces most of the core of the beam, and the\ngaussian with the larger dimensions largely produces the long tail of the beam.\nThe final result for the growth rates are expressed as the sum of three terms\nwhich can be interperted respectively as the contribution to the growth rates\ndue to the scattering of the particles in the first gaussian from themselves,\nthe scattering of the particles in the second gaussian from themselves, and the\nscattering of the particles in the first gaussian from the particles in the\nsecond gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2004 14:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2005 17:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
