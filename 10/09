The variations of the viewing angle suggest that a supermassive\nblack hole binary system may exist in the center of 3C273. The gap between the\ninner and outer jet in some radio loud AGNs my be explained in terms of Doppler\ndeboosting effects when the components accelerate to ultra-relativistic speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2004 16:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To evaluate the\ncontribution of trapped particles to the transverse current density components\nthe Vlasov equation is solved using a standard method of switching to new\nvariables associated with conservation integrals; new time-like variable is\nintroduced (instead of the geomagnetic latitude angle) to describe the\nbounce-motion of trapped particles along the geomagnetic field; the perturbed\nelectric field and current density components are Fourier-decomposed over the\nlength of the geomagnetic field lines. As a result, the transverse permittivity\nelements are expressed by summation of bounce-resonant terms including the\ndouble integration in velocity space, the resonant denominators, and the\ncorresponding phase coefficients. Due to geomagnetic field nonuniformity, the\nwave-particle resonance conditions in magnetospheric plasmas are entirely\ndifferent from ones in the straight magnetic field; the all spectrum of the\nelectric field is present in the given current density harmonic; the left- and\nright-hand polarized waves are coupled.
