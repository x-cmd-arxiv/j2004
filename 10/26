We have got from ESO 17 hours of\nadditional exposure on this star in order to secure a detection of the minimum\namount of lead expected to be present in CS 31082-001, the amount arising from\nthe decay of the original content of Th and U in the star. We report here this\nsuccessful detection. We find an LTE abundance log(Pb/H)+12=-0.55 \\pm 0.15 dex,\none dex below the upper limits given by other authors for the similar stars CS\n22892-052 and BD +17d3248, also enhanced in r-process elements. From the\nobserved present abundances of Th and U in the star, the expected amount of Pb\nproduced by the decay of 232Th, and 238U alone, over 12-15 Gyr is -0.73\\pm 0.17\ndex. The decay of 235U is more difficult to estimate, but is probably slightly\nbelow the contribution of 238U, making the contribution of the 3 actinides only\nslightly below, or even equal to, the measured abundance. The contribution from\nthe decay of 234U has was not included, for lack of published data. In this\nsense our determination is a lower limit to the contribution of actinides to\nlead production. We comment this result, and we note that if a NLTE analysis,\nnot yet possible, doubles our observed abundance, the decay of the 3 actinides\nwill still represent 50 per cent of the total lead, a proportion higher than\nthe values considered so far in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2004 13:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In these detectors, the\nspacecraft-to-spacecraft light-travel times will necessarily be unequal and\ntime-varying, and (because of aberration) will have different values on up- and\ndown-links. In such unequal-armlength interferometers, laser phase noise will\nbe canceled by taking linear combinations of the laser-phase observables\nmeasured between pairs of spacecraft, appropriately time-shifted by the light\npropagation times along the corresponding arms. This procedure, known as\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI), requires an accurate knowledge of the\nlight-time delays as functions of time. Here we propose a high-accuracy\ntechnique to estimate these time delays and study its use in the context of the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We refer to this ranging\ntechnique, which relies on the TDI combinations themselves, as Time-Delay\nInterferometric Ranging (TDIR).

The method is based in reformulating\nexplicit schemes in matrix form, which cane modified gradually into semi or\nstrongly-implicit schemes. From the point of view of matrix-algebra, explicit\nnumerical methods are special cases in which the global matrix of coefficients\nis reduced to the identity matrix $I$. This extreme simplification leads to\nseverer stability range, hence of their robustness. In this paper it is shown\nthat a condition, which is similar to the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL)\ncondition can be obtained from the stability requirement of inversion of the\ncoefficient matrix. This condition is shown to be relax-able, and that a class\nof methods that range from explicit to strongly implicit methods can be\nconstructed, whose degree of implicitness depends on the number of coefficients\nused in constructing the corresponding coefficient-matrices. Special attention\nis given to a simple and tractable semi-explicit method, which is obtained by\nmodifying the coefficient matrix from the identity matrix $I$ into a\ndiagonal-matrix $D$. This method is shown to be stable, robust and it can be\napplied to search for stationary solutions using large CFL-numbers, though it\nconverges slower than its implicit counterpart. Moreover, the method can be\napplied to follow the evolution of strongly time-dependent flows, though it is\nnot as efficient as normal explicit methods. In addition, we find that the\nresidual smoothing method accelerates convergene toward steady state solutions\nconsiderably and improves the efficiency of the solution procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2004 15:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A crucial aspect of the\ntheory is that both the intra-molecular and inter-molecular excitons are\neffective-particles, which are described by both a relative-particle\nwavefunction and a center-of-mass wavefunction. This implies two electronic\nselection rules. (1) The parity of the relative-particle wavefunction implies\nthat inter-conversion occurs from the even parity inter-molecular\ncharge-transfer excitons to the strongly bound intra-molecular excitons. (2)\nThe orthonormality of the center-of-mass wavefunctions ensures that\ninter-conversion occurs from the charge-transfer excitons to the lowest branch\nof the strongly bound exciton families, and not to higher lying members of\nthese families. The inter-conversion is then predominately a multi-phonon\nprocess, determined by the Franck-Condon factors.
