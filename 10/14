Our model uses Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a\nLCDM cosmology, coupled to semi-analytical recipes, to follow the merger\nhistory of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the MBHs they host, and their\ngrowth via gas accretion and binary coalescences. The coalescence of comparable\nmass holes increases the spin of MBHs, while the capture of smaller companions\nin randomly-oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. We find that, given the\ndistribution of MBH binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binary\ncoalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of MBHs\nwith time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions. By\ncontrast, because of the Bardeen-Petterson effect, gas accretion via a thin\ndisk tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis changes\nrandomly in time. In our models, accretion dominates over black hole captures\nand efficiently spins holes up.

Most simulations of star forming clusters\nuse an isothermal equation of state (EOS).

We estimate the concentration of light (C) at the galaxy\ncenter and the 180 degree-rotational asymmetry (A), computed at several\nwavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) to I-band. The variation of the indices of\nconcentration and asymmetry with the wavelength reflects the proportion and the\ndistribution of young and old stellar populations in galaxies. In general C is\nfound to decrease from optical to UV, and A is found to increase from optical\nto UV: the patchy appearance of galaxies in UV with no bulge is often very\ndifferent from their counterpart at optical wavelengths, with prominent bulges\nand more regular disks. The variation of C and A with the wavelength is\nquantified. By this way, we are able to distinguish five types of galaxies that\nwe call spectro-morphological types: compact, ringed, spiral, irregular and\ncentral-starburst galaxies, which can be differentiated by the repartition of\ntheir stellar populations.

The aim of this\nreview is to summarize the various numerical and analytical results that have\nbeen recently obtained for this case. Particular emphasis is put to the\nfield-theoretical methods that can be used to provide analytical predictions\nfor the relevant dynamical quantities. Fluctuation-dissipation relations are\ndiscussed and in particular the concept of fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR)\nis reviewed, emphasizing its connection with the definition of a possible\neffective temperature. The Renormalization-Group approach to critical dynamics\nis summarized and the scaling forms of the time-dependent non-equilibrium\ncorrelation and response functions of a generic observable are discussed. From\nthem the universality of the associated FDR follows as an amplitude ratio. It\nis then possible to provide predictions for ageing quantities in a variety of\ndifferent models. In particular the results for Model A, B, and C dynamics of\nthe O(N) Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian, and Model A dynamics of the weakly dilute\nIsing magnet and of a \\phi^3 theory, are reviewed and compared with the\navailable numerical results and exact solutions.

We compute full phase diagrams in the plane of colloid and polymer volume\nfractions, using the moment free energy method. The intricate features of phase\nseparation in pure polydisperse colloids combine with the appearance of\npolymer-induced gas-liquid coexistence to give a rich variety of phase diagram\ntopologies as the polymer-colloid size ratio and the colloid polydispersity are\nvaried.

Phase splits\ninvolving two or more solids can occur already at low colloid concentration,\nwhere they may be kinetically accessible. We also analyse the strength of\ncolloidal size fractionation.

Thereby the large variety of scaling functions for masses and\ncouplings can be reduced to a restricted set of functions with a constrained\ndependence on a scalar field. We show how by choosing properly the latter\nscaling functions one may stiffen or soften the equation of state at high\ndensities and simultaneously increase the threshold density for the direct Urca\nprocess without any change of the description of nuclear matter close to the\nsaturation density. The stiffening of the equation of state might be motivated\nby recent neutron star mass measurements, whereas the increase of the threshold\ndensity for the direct Urca process is required by the analysis of neutron star\ncooling data. We demonstrate that if a rho meson is included in a mean-field\nmodel as a non-Abelian gauge boson, then there is a possibility for a charged\nrho-meson condensation in dense nuclear matter. We show that such a novel phase\ncan be realized in neutron star interiors already for sufficiently low\ndensities, typically $\\sim 3\\div 4 n_0$, where $n_0$ is the nuclear saturation\ndensity.

Such scheme automatically incorporates all the essential\nfeatures that make quantum information encoding much more efficient than\nclassical: it is fully discrete; it deals with inherently entangled states,\nnaturally endowed with a tensor product structure; it allows for generic\nencoding patterns. The model proposed can be thought of as the non-Boolean\ngeneralization of the quantum circuit model, with unitary gates expressed in\nterms of 3nj coefficients connecting inequivalent binary coupling schemes of\nn+1 angular momentum variables, as well as Wigner rotations in the eigenspace\nof the total angular momentum.

There are many efficient\ndecoupling schemes based on combinatorial concepts like orthogonal arrays,\ndifference schemes and Hadamard matrices. So far these (combinatorial)\ndecoupling schemes have relied on the ability to effect sequences of\ninstantaneous, arbitrarily strong control Hamiltonians (bang-bang controls). To\novercome the shortcomings of bang-bang control Viola and Knill proposed a\nmethod called Eulerian decoupling that allows the use of bounded-strength\ncontrols for decoupling. However, their method was not directly designed to\ntake advantage of the composite structure of multipartite quantum systems. In\nthis paper we define a combinatorial structure called an Eulerian orthogonal\narray. It merges the desirable properties of orthogonal arrays and Eulerian\ncycles in Cayley graphs (that are the basis of Eulerian decoupling). We show\nthat this structure gives rise to decoupling schemes with bounded-strength\ncontrol Hamiltonians that can be applied to composite quantum systems with few\nbody Hamiltonians and special couplings with the environment. Furthermore, we\nshow how to construct Eulerian orthogonal arrays having good parameters in\norder to obtain efficient decoupling schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2004 01:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We demonstate\nthat an appropriate sequence of nearly abrupt changes of the resonance\nfrequency can protect the qubit state from decay and decoherence more\neffectively than the intuitively obvious alternative, which is to fix the\nresonance well within a forbidden bandgap of the reservoir spectrum, as far as\npossible from the continuum edge. The \"counterintuitive\" nonadiabatic method\noutlined here can outperform its adiabatic counterparts in maintaining a high\nfidelity of quantum logic operations. The remarkable effectiveness of the\nproposed method, which requires much lower rates of frequency changes than\npreviously proposed control methods, is due to the ability of appropriately\nalternating detunings from the continuum edge to augment the interference of\nthe emitted and back-scattered quanta, thereby helping to stabilize the qubit\nstate against decay.
