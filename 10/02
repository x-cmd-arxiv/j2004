C2H\nand C34S, tracers of PDR chemistry, originate exclusively from the central\n50-100 pc region, where radiation fields are high. The third group of\nmolecules, CH3OH and HNCO, correlates well with the expected locations of\nbar-induced orbital shocks. The good correlation of HNCO with the established\nshock tracer molecule CH3OH is evidence that this molecule, whose chemistry has\nbeen uncertain, is indeed produced by processing of grains. HC3N is observed to\ncorrelate tightly with 3mm continuum emission, demonstrating that the young\nstarbursts are the sites of the warmest and densest molecular gas. We compare\nour HNC images with the HCN images of Downes et al. (1992) to produce the first\nhigh resolution, extragalactic HCN/HNC map: the HNC/HCN ratio is near unity\nacross the nucleus and the correlation of both of these gas tracers with the\nstar formation is excellent.

This is done in the context canonical\nframework with two different techniques known as soldering formalism and dual\nprojection formalism. The first considers the phenomenon of interference\nbetween chiral modes and the second is able to separate dynamics from the\nsymmetry behavior in a quantum field theory. While the soldering formalism\ndiscloses phenomena analogous to the double slit interference phenomena in\nclassical-quantum physics with important consequences to the bosonization\nprogram, the dual projection, in particular, is able to disclose the presence\nof a noton, a nonmover field, in different formulations for chiral bosons. The\nimportance of this last result is that it proves the duality between Siegel and\nFloreanini-Jackiw model without invoking gauge-fixing: while the\nFloreanini-Jackiw component describes the dynamics, it is the noton that\ncarries the symmetry contents, acquiring dynamics upon quantization and is\nfully responsible for the Siegel anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2004 05:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2005 14:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our formalism\nis built upon an expansion of the product $C^\\dagger C$ of cluster amplitudes\n$C$ into a sum of $n$-body insertions. We consider two types of insertions:\nparticle/hole line insertion and two-particle/two-hole\nrandom-phase-approximation-like insertion. We demonstrate how to ``dress''\nthese insertions and formulate iterative equations. We illustrate the dressing\nequations in the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and\ndouble excitations. Using univalent systems as an example, we upgrade\ncoupled-cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions and\nhighlight a relation to pertinent fourth-order diagrams. We illustrate our\nformalism with relativistic calculations of hyperfine constant $A(6s)$ and\n$6s_{1/2}-6p_{1/2}$ electric-dipole transition amplitude for Cs atom. Finally,\nwe augment the truncated coupled-cluster calculations with otherwise omitted\nfourth-order diagrams. The resulting analysis for Cs is complete through the\nfourth-order of many-body perturbation theory and reveals an important role of\ntriple and disconnected quadruple excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2004 20:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
