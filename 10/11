This nearly face-on disk is optically thick,\nsurrounding a classical T Tauri star in the nearby 10 Myr old TW Hya\nassociation. The spectrum was taken with the HST-STIS CCD, providing resolution\nR ~ 360 over the wavelength range 5250 - 10300 A. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy of circumstellar disks is difficult due to the high contrast ratio\nbetween the bright star and faint disk. Our novel observations provide optical\nspectra of scattered light from the disk between 40 AU and 155 AU from the\nstar. The scattered light has the same color as the star (gray scattering) at\nall radii, except the innermost region. This likely indicates that the\nscattering dust grains are larger than about 1 micron all the way out to large\nradii. From the spectroscopic data, we also obtained radial profiles of the\nintegrated disk brightness at two position angles, over almost the same region\nas previously observed in HST-WFPC2 and NICMOS coronagraphic images (35 AU to\n173 AU from the star). The profiles have the same shape as the earlier ones,\nbut show a small azimuthal asymmetry in the disk not previously noted. Our STIS\nbroad-band coronagraphic images of TW Hya confirm the reality of this\nasymmetry, and show that the disk surface brightness interior to 140 AU has a\nsinusoidal dependence on azimuthal angle. The maximum brightness occurs at a\nposition angle of 233.6 +/- 5.7 degrees East of North. This might be caused by\nthe combination of forward-scattering and an increase in inclination in the\ninner region of the disk, suggesting that the TW Hya disk has a warp like that\nseen in the Beta Pictoris debris disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2004 21:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 14:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The order parameter is\nassociated with a phase transition to an absorbing state. Given a process that\nexhibits a phase transition to an absorbing state, we define an ``extremal\nabsorbing\" process, providing the link to the associated extremal\n(nonabsorbing) process. Stationary properties of the latter correspond to those\nat the absorbing-state phase transition in the former. Studying the absorbing\nversion of an extremal dynamics model allows to determine certain critical\nexponents that are not otherwise accessible. In the case of the Bak-Sneppen\n(BS) model, the absorbing version is closely related to the \"$f$-avalanche\"\nintroduced by Paczuski, Maslov and Bak [Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 53}, 414 (1996)], or,\nin spreading simulations to the \"BS branching process\" also studied by these\nauthors. The corresponding nonextremal process belongs to the directed\npercolation universality class. We revisit the absorbing BS model, obtaining\nrefined estimates for the threshold and critical exponents in one dimension. We\nalso study an extremal version of the usual contact process, using mean-field\ntheory and simulation. The extremal condition slows the spread of activity and\nmodifies the critical behavior radically, defining an ``extremal directed\npercolation\" universality class of absorbing-state phase transitions.\nAsymmetric updating is a relevant perturbation for this class, even though it\nis irrelevant for the corresponding nonextremal class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 14:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We suggest that the \"large brane instability\" of Seiberg and\nWitten eliminates the negative candidates in the context of string theory. That\nleaves the flat, compact, three-dimensional manifolds -- Conway's *platycosms*.\nWe show that deep theorems of Schoen, Yau, Gromov and Lawson imply that, even\nin this case, Seiberg-Witten instability can be avoided only with difficulty.\nUsing a specific cosmological model of the Maldacena-Maoz type, we explain how\nto do this, and we also show how the list of platycosmic candidates can be\nreduced to three. This leads to an extension of the basic idea: the conformal\ncompactification of the entire Euclidean spacetime also has the topology of a\nflat, compact, four-dimensional space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 11:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2004 08:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-23"}

In Part II we\nderive the quantum formalism from information-theoretic axioms and we analyze\nthe twofold role of observer as physical system and as informational agent.\nQuantum logical techniques are then introduced, and we prove theorems\nreconstructing elements of the formalism. In Part III, we introduce the\nformalism of C*-algebras and give it an information theoretic interpretation.\nWe analyze the conceptual underpinnings of the theory of modular automorphisms\nand we give an information-theoretic justification for the emergence of time in\nthe algebraic approach. We conclude by giving a list of open questions,\nincluding topics in cognitive science, decision theory, and information\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 14:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

As a consequence, complete information about\nthe pulse cannot, even in principle, be perfectly recorded in a classical\nmemory. In the field of quantum information this has led to a long standing\nchallenge: how to achieve a high-fidelity transfer of an independently prepared\nquantum state of light onto the atomic quantum state? Here we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate a protocol for such quantum memory based on atomic\nensembles. We demonstrate for the first time a recording of an externally\nprovided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory with a fidelity\nup to 70%, significantly higher than that for the classical recording. Quantum\nstorage of light is achieved in three steps: an interaction of light with\natoms, the subsequent measurement on the transmitted light, and the feedback\nonto the atoms conditioned on the measurement result. Density of recorded\nstates 33% higher than that for the best classical recording of light on atoms\nis achieved. A quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 msec is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2004 13:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
