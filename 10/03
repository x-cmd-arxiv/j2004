The rotational evolution of solar-mass\nstars is mainly determined by the magnetic interaction with their circumstellar\ndisk and angular momentum loss through stellar winds, and In contrast to\nsolar-mass stars, very low mass (VLM) objects and brown dwarfs are believed to\nbe fully convective. This may lead to major differences of rotation and\nactivity, since fully convective objects may not host a solar-type dynamo.\nHere, we report on our observational efforts to understand the rotational\nevolution of VLM objects. By means of photometric monitoring, we determined 62\nrotation periods for targets in three clusters, which form an age sequence from\n3 to 125 Myr. We find that VLM objects rotate faster than their solar-mass\nsiblings in all evolutionary stages. Their rotational evolution seems to be\ndetermined by hydrostatic contraction and exponential angular momentum loss.\nThe photometric amplitudes of the light curves are much lower than for\nsolar-mass stars. This may be explained as a consequence of smaller spot\ncoverage, more symmetric spot distributions, or lower contrast between spots\nand their environment. Most of these results can be explained with a change of\nthe magnetic field properties with decreasing mass.

We show how to extend equivariant\nvector bundles on $G/K$ to equivariant vector bundles on $X$, generated by\ntheir global sections and having trivial higher cohomology groups. This relies\non a geometric construction of equivariant vector bundles in the setting of\nvarieties with reductive group action and ``multiplicity-free'' subvarieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2004 13:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
