Thus, all AGNs drop in luminosity by almost an order of\nmagnitude over this redshift range. We show that this observed drop is due to\nAGN downsizing.

NB) quasi-interpolant (abbr. QI) is an\napproximation operator of the form $Q_af=\\sum_{\\alpha\\in A} \\Lambda_\\alpha (f)\nB_\\alpha$ where the $B_\\alpha$'s are B-splines and the $\\Lambda_\\alpha (f)$'s\nare linear discrete or integral forms acting on the given function $f$. These\nforms depend on a finite number of coefficients which are the components of\nvectors $a_\\alpha$ for $\\alpha\\in A$. The index $a$ refers to this sequence of\nvectors. In order that $Q_a p=p$ for all polynomials $p$ belonging to some\nsubspace included in the space of splines generated by the $B_\\alpha$'s, each\nvector $a_\\alpha$ must lie in an affine subspace $V_\\alpha$, i.e. satisfy some\nlinear constraints. However there remain some degrees of freedom which are used\nto minimize $\\Vert a_\\alpha \\Vert_1$ for each $\\alpha\\in A$. It is easy to\nprove that $\\max \\{\\Vert a_\\alpha \\Vert_1 ; \\alpha\\in A\\}$ is an upper bound of\n$\\Vert Q_a \\Vert_{\\infty}$: thus, instead of minimizing the infinite norm of\n$Q_a$, which is a difficult problem, we minimize an upper bound of this norm,\nwhich is much easier to do. Moreover, the latter problem has always at least\none solution, which is associated with a NB QI. In the first part of the paper,\nwe give a survey on NB univariate or bivariate spline QIs defined on uniform or\nnon-uniform partitions and already studied by the author and coworkers. In the\nsecond part, we give some new results, mainly on univariate and bivariate\nintegral QIs on {\\sl non-uniform} partitions: in that case, NB QIs are more\ndifficult to characterize and the optimal properties strongly depend on the\ngeometry of the partition. Therefore we have restricted our study to QIs having\ninteresting shape properties and/or infinite norms uniformly bounded\nindependently of the partition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2004 13:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In previous results [IEEE\nTrans. Plasma Sci. 29, 182 (2001)], it was shown that for a class of size\ndistributions, there is an equivalence to a Lorentzian distribution of\nmono-sized particles. The electrostatic response to a slowly moving test\ncharge, using a second order approximation can then be found [Phys. Lett. A\n305, 79 (2002)]. It is also well known [Phys.

It seems natural at this stage to seek the combined effects of grain\nsize distribution and grain charging dynamics to a test charge moving through\nthe dusty plasma. Here we consider the effects of both grain size distribution\nand dynamical grain charging to a test charge moving slowly in a dusty plasma\nby expressing the plasma dielectric response as a function of both grain size\ndistribution and grain charging dynamics.
