Here,\non the basis of that relationship, I derive expressions, as a function of the\nmass of planet Mercury and the mass of its core, to estimate the mass of\nMercury's lost elements, the mass of Mercury's alloy and rock protoplanetary\ncore, and the mass of Mercury's gaseous protoplanet. Although Mercury's mass is\nwell known, its core mass is not, being widely believed to be in the range of\n70-80 percent of the planet mass. For a core mass of 75 percent, the mass of\nMercury's lost elements is about 1.32 times the mass of Mercury, the mass of\nthe alloy and rock protoplanetary core is about 2.32 times the mass of Mercury,\nand the mass of the gaseous protoplanet of Mercury is about 700 times the mass\nof Mercury. Circumstantial evidence is presented in support of the supposition\nthat Mercury's lost elements is identical to the planetary component of\nordinary chondrite formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2004 13:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We are concerned with the\nfollowing question: Can we realize the information theoretically secure\nsymmetric key cipher under \"the finite secret key\" based on quantum-optical\ncommunications? A role of quantum information theory is to give an answer for\nsuch a question. As an answer for the question, a new quantum cryptography was\nproposed by H.P.Yuen, which can realize a secure symmetric key cipher with high\nspeeds(Gbps) and for long distance(1000 Km). Although some researchers claim\nthat Yuen protocol(Y-00) is equivalent to the classical cryptography, they are\nall mistaken. Indeed it has no classical analogue, and also provides a\ngeneralization even in the conventional cryptography.\n  At present, it is proved that a basic model of Y-00 has at least the security\nsuch as $H(X|Y_E)=H(K|Y_E)=H(K)$, $H(K|Y_E,X)\\sim 0$ under the average photon\nnumber per signal light pulse:$<n> \\sim 10000$. Towards our final goal, in this\npaper, we clarify a role of classical randomness(secret key) and quantum\nrandomness in Y-00, and give a rigorous quantum mechanical interpretation of\nthe security, showing an analysis of quantum collective attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2004 07:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
