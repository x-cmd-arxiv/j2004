An inherent difficulty with high-redshift observations\nis that the objects are very faint and the best resolution (HST) is only ~0.5\nkpc. Such studies thereby combine in a highly synergistic way with the great\ndetail that can be obtained for nearby galaxies. 3 new developments are\nhighlighted. First is the derivation of stellar masses for galaxies from SEDs\nusing HST and now Spitzer data, and dynamical masses from both sub-mm\nobservations of CO lines and near-IR observations of optical lines like Halpha.\nA major step has been taken with evidence that points to the z~2-3 LBGs having\nmasses that are a few x 10^10 Msolar. Second is the discovery of a population\nof evolved red galaxies at z~2-3 which appear to be the progenitors of the more\nmassive early-type galaxies of today, with dynamical masses around a few x\n10^11 Msolar. Third are the remarkable advances that have occurred in\ncharacterizing dropout galaxies to z~6 and beyond, < 1 Gyr from recombination.\nThe HST ACS has played a key role here, with the dropout technique being\napplied to i & z images in several deep ACS fields, yielding large samples of\nthese objects. This has allowed a detailed determination of their properties\nand meaningful comparisons against lower-z samples. The use of cloning\ntechniques has overcome many of the strong selection biases affecting the study\nof these objects. A clear trend of size with redshift has been identified, and\nits impact on the luminosity density and SFR estimated. There is a significant\nthough modest decrease in the SFR from z~2.5 to z~6. The latest data also allow\nfor the first robust determination of the LF at z~6. Finally, the latest UDF\nACS and NICMOS data has resulted in the detection of some galaxies at z~7-8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2004 18:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Recent\nobservations, from the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer to the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Project, have strikingly confirmed this prediction. CMB\nfluctuations provide clues to the Universe's structure and composition shortly\nafter the Big Bang that are critical for testing cosmological models. For\nexample, CMB data can be used to determine what portion of the Universe is\ncomposed of ordinary matter versus the mysterious dark matter and dark energy.\nTo this end, cosmologists usually summarize the fluctuations by the power\nspectrum, which gives the variance as a function of angular frequency.

Thus, a critical\nstatistical question is how accurately can these peaks be estimated. We use\nrecently developed techniques to construct a nonparametric confidence set for\nthe unknown CMB spectrum.

We define ``golden'' binary mergers to be those with measurement errors\nlikely to be small enough for a physically useful determination of $M_{\\rm\nGW}$. A detailed sensitivity study, combined with simple black hole population\nmodels, suggests that a few golden binary mergers may be detected during a\n3-year {\\it LISA} mission lifetime. Any such mass deficit measurement would\nconstitute a robust and valuable observational test of strong-field\nrelativistic gravity. An extension of this concept to include spin measurements\nmay allow a direct empirical test of the black hole area theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2004 14:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2005 22:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We determine the average spectra of the objects and\nfind a marked difference between the soft-band selected sources, which have\nGamma=1.9 typical of unobscured AGN, and the hard-band selected sources, which\nhave Gamma=1.0.

Nonetheless, our results\nimply that the fraction of sources with significant obscuration is only ~25 per\ncent, much less than predicted by standard AGN population synthesis models.\nThis is confirmed by direct spectral fitting, with only a handful of objects\nshowing evidence for absorption.

To find the reason of the disparity, we re-examine the distribution\nfunction of bond animals; the analysis showing that the percolation process\ndiffers from real gelations in two points: (i) whereas the real gelation obeys\nthe principle of equireactivity of functional units, the percolation process\ndoes not; (ii) the substantial reduction of functionality occurs through the\npercolation process. These make the lattice model intrinsically different from\nreal chemical processes. As a result, one can not make use of the percolation\ntheory for the purpose of examining the validity of the gelation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2004 01:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have\nperformed extensive tests of the numerical code, including quantitative\ncomparisons to previous approximative results for these models. The results\npresented here are the first ``exact'' calculations of such models in the sense\nthat no approximations (other than that inherent in a discretized numerical\ntreatment) are used. Using this code we reconfirm the existence of\nprolate-oblate shaped configurations. We studied the dependency of the Kepler\nrotation limit and of the mass-density relation on the relative rotation rate.\nWe further demonstrate how one can simulate a (albeit fluid) neutron-star\n``crust'' by letting one fluid extend further outwards than the other, which\nresults in interesting cases where the Kepler limit is actually determined by\nthe outermost but slower fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2004 21:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2005 09:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper\nwe derive a ``third-order'' generalization of the FKG inequality.\n  We also establish fourth- and fifth-order generalizations of the FKG\ninequality and formulate a conjecture for a general mth-order generalization.\nFor functions and measures on R^n we establish these inequalities by extending\nthe method of diffusion processes. We provide several applications of the\nthird-order inequality, generalizing earlier applications of the FKG\ninequality.\n  Finally, we remark on some connections between the theory of total positivity\nand the existence of inequalities of FKG-type within the context of Riemannian\nmanifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2004 12:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The author intends to show that GR and Quantum Mechanics (QM) can\nbe seen as originating from properties of the null subspace of 5-dimensional\nspace with signature (-++++), together with its associated geometric algebra\nG(4,1). Besides generating GR and QM, the same space generates also\n4-dimensional Euclidean space where dynamics can be formulated and is quite\noften equivalent to the relativistic counterpart. Euclidean relativistic\ndynamics resembles Fermat's principle extended to 4 dimensions and is thus\ndesignated as 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO). In this presentation the author uses\nG(4,1) with imposition of the null displacement length condition and derives\nthe method to transpose between the metrics of GR and 4DO; this transition is\nproven viable for stationary metrics. It is hopeless to apply Einstein type\nequations in 4DO, for the simple reason that a null Ricci tensor always leads\nto a metric diverging to infinity. The author uses geometric arguments to\nestablish alternative equations which are solved for the case of a stationary\nmass and produce a solution equivalent to Schwarzschild's metric in terms of\nPPN parameters. As a further development, the author analyses the case of a\nmonogenic function in G(4,1).

The formulation of Proposition 1 of\nRef. 1 does not ensure the triangle inequality, therefore some of the\nfunctionals D(a,b) in Ref. 1 are in fact quasi-distances. In this note we\nformulate sufficient conditions for a functional D(a,b) of the (squared) form\nD(a,b)^2 = f(a)^2 + f(b)^2 - 2f(a)f(b)g(a,b) to be a distance and provide some\nexamples of such distances. A one parameter generalization of a bounded\ndistance of the (squared) form D(a,b)^2 = D_0^2 (1 - g(a,b)), which includes\nthe known Bures-Uhlmann and Hilbert-Schmidt distances between quantum states,\nis established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2004 13:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
