The Doppler shifts reveal outflows of relatively cool gas at $330 \\pm\n100$km/s. The outflow speeds increase with the star formation rate (SFR) as\nroughly $v \\propto SFR^{0.35}$. This result is surprising since, in the\ntraditional model for starburst-driven winds, these relatively cool gas clouds\nare accelerated by the ram pressure of a hot, supernova-heated wind that\nexhibits weak (if any) \\x temperature variation with increasing galactic mass.\nThe lack of evidence for much hotter winds is partly a sensitivity issue; but\nthe outflow velocities in ultraluminous starbursts actually are consistent with\nacceleration by the tepid wind, indicating a hotter component is unlikely to\ndominate the momentum flux. The \\nad velocities in the dwarf starburst winds do\nnot reach the terminal velocity of a hot wind at the measured temperature of kT\n~0.73 keV. A dynamically-motivated explanation is that the dwarf starburst\nwinds simply lack enough momentum to accelerate the clouds to the velocity of\nthe hot wind. Among the subsample of starbursts with well- constrained\ndynamical masses, the terminal outflow velocities approach the galactic escape\nvelocity. If this relation, which is similar to that observed for stellar\nwinds, arises from radiation pressure on dust and gas limiting the maximum\nluminosity of a starburst, then feedback will be stronger in massive galaxies\nthan previously thought helping shape the high-mass end of the galaxy\nluminosity function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2004 22:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Whereas these tadpoles are typically large, a closer look at\nthe problem from a perturbative viewpoint has the potential of illuminating at\nleast some of its qualitative features in String Theory. A possible scheme to\nthis effect was proposed long ago by Fischler and Susskind, but incorporating\nbackground redefinitions in string amplitudes in a systematic fashion has long\nproved very difficult. In the first part of this paper, drawing from field\ntheory examples, we thus begin to explore what one can learn by working\nperturbatively in a ``wrong'' vacuum. While unnatural in Field Theory, this\nprocedure presents evident advantages in String Theory, whose definition in\ncurved backgrounds is mostly beyond reach at the present time. At the field\ntheory level, we also identify and characterize some special choices of vacua\nwhere tadpole resummations terminate after a few contributions. In the second\npart we present a notable example where vacuum redefinitions can be dealt with\nto some extent at the full string level, providing some evidence for a new link\nbetween IIB and 0B orientifolds. We finally show that NS-NS tadpoles do not\nmanifest themselves to lowest order in certain classes of string constructions\nwith broken supersymmetry and parallel branes, including brane-antibrane pairs\nand brane supersymmetry breaking models, that therefore have UV finite\nthreshold corrections at one loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2004 21:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2004 23:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2004 17:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 19:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We present a quantum gate array which implements any n-qubit gate\nof this type using at most 2^{n-1} - 1 controlled-NOT gates, 2^{n-1} one-qubit\ngates and a single diagonal n-qubit gate. The circuit is based on the so-called\nquantum multiplexor, for which we provide a modified construction. We\nillustrate the versatility of these gates by applying them to the decomposition\nof a general n-qubit gate and a local state preparation procedure. Moreover, we\nstudy their implementation using only nearest-neighbor gates. We give upper\nbounds for the one-qubit and controlled-NOT gate counts for all the\naforementioned applications. In all four cases, the proposed circuit topologies\neither improve on or achieve the previously reported upper bounds for the gate\ncounts. Thus, they provide the most efficient method for general gate\ndecompositions currently known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 2004 19:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 13:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We first divide the density matrix of each mixed\nstate into two parts by the fact that it comes from ensemble of pure quantum\nstates. The first part will not contribute anything to the discrimination, the\nsecond part has support space linearly independent to each other. Then the\nproblem we consider can be reduced to a problem in which the strategy of set\ndiscrimination can be used in designing measurements to discriminate mixed\nstates unambiguously. We find a necessary and sufficient condition of\nunambiguous mixed state discrimination, and also point out that searching the\noptimal success probability of unambiguous discrimination is mathematically the\nwell-known semi-definite programming problem. A upper bound of the optimal\nsuccess probability is also presented. Finally, We generalize the concept of\nset discrimination to mixed state and point out that the problem of\ndiscriminating it unambiguously is equivalent to that of unambiguously\ndiscriminating mixed states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2004 07:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 19:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 18:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
