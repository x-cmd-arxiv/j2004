In any case, this point of view suggests\nvast generalizations leading to the Hopf algebras of endomorphisms and word\nHopf algebras with which this paper is concerned. This point of view also sheds\nlight on the somewhat mysterious formulas of MPR and on the question where all\nthe extra structure (such as autoduality) comes from. The paper concludes with\na few sections on the structure of MPR and the question of algebra retractions\nof the natural inclusion of Hopf algebras of NSymm into MPR and section of the\nnaural projection of MPR onto QSymm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 2004 08:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the most central Au+Au collisions\nat the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high\nenergy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of\nfreedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system\nare found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of\nparticle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple\nscaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in\nsimpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged\nparticles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing\nAu+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of\nparticipants at higher pT (~4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse\nmomentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and\nelliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of\npseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the\ncolliding nuclei, a property we describe as \"extended longitudinal scaling''.\nFinally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were\nfound to factorize to a surprising degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 2004 17:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2005 13:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
