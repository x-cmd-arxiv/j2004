In this paper we perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis on\ngalaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, classified by both colour and\nspectral type, eta, as early or late type galaxies. We fit three different\nmodels of relative bias to the joint probability distribution of the cell\ncounts, assuming Poisson sampling of the galaxy density field. We investigate\nthe nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relative bias, with cubical cells of\nside 10Mpc \\leq L \\leq 45Mpc (h=0.7). Exact linear bias is ruled out with high\nsignificance on all scales. Power law bias gives a better fit, but likelihood\nratios prefer a bivariate lognormal distribution, with a non-zero\n`stochasticity' - i.e. scatter that may result from physical effects on galaxy\nformation other than those from the local density field. Using this model, we\nmeasure a correlation coefficient in log-density space (r_LN) of 0.958 for\ncells of length L=10Mpc, increasing to 0.970 by L=45Mpc.

Here, the relative intensities of faint optical\nrecombination lines (ORLs) from ions of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are\nanalysed in order to derive the abundances of these ions relative to hydrogen.\nWe define an abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) as the ratio of the abundance\nderived for a heavy element ion from its recombination lines to that derived\nfor the same ion from its ultraviolet, optical or infrared collisionally\nexcited lines (CELs). All of the PNe in our sample are found to have ADF's that\nexceed unity.

Observations suggest that star\nformation in BCDs occurs in two different regimes: \"active\" and \"passive\". The\n\"active\" BCDs host super star clusters (SSCs), and are characterised by compact\nsize, rich H2 content, large dust optical depth, and high dust temperature; the\n\"passive\" BCDs are more diffuse with cooler dust, and lack SSCs and large\namounts of H2. By treating physical processes concerning formation of stars and\ndust, we are able to simultaneously reproduce all the above properties of both\nmodes of star formation (active and passive). We find that the difference\nbetween the two regimes can be understood through the variation of the\n\"compactness\" of the star-forming region: an \"active\" mode emerges if the\nregion is compact (with radius $\\la 50$ pc) and dense (with gas number density\n$\\ga 500$ cm$^{-3}$). The dust, supplied from Type II supernovae in a compact\nstar-forming region, effectively reprocesses the heating photons into the\ninfrared and induces a rapid H2 formation over a period of several Myr. This\nexplains the high infrared luminosity, high dust temperature, and large H2\ncontent of active BCDs. Moreover, the gas in \"active\" galaxies cools ($\\la 300$\nK) on a few dynamical timescales, producing a \"run-away\" star formation episode\nbecause of the favourable (cool) conditions. The mild extinction and relatively\nlow molecular content of passive BCDs can also be explained by the same model\nif we assume a diffuse region (with radius $\\ga 100$ pc and gas number density\n$\\la 100$ cm$^{-3}$).

Obvious examples of E-rings are subrings\nof Q. However there is a proper class of examples constructed recently. E-rings\ncome up naturally in various topics of algebra.
