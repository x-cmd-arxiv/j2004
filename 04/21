The giant Zeeman effect\ninduces a significant spin splitting even at very small values of the applied\nfield. Several methods of measuring the carrier density (Hall effect, filling\nfactors of the Landau levels at high field, various manifestations of\nMoss-Burstein shifts) are described and calibrated. The value of the spin\nsplitting needed to fully polarize the hole gas, evidences a strong enhancement\nof the spin susceptibility of the hole gas due to carrier-carrier interaction.\nAt small values of the spin splitting, whatever the carrier density (non zero)\nis, photoluminescence lines are due to the formation of charged excitons in the\nsinglet state. Spectral shifts in photoluminescence and in transmission\n(including an \"excitonic Moss-Bustein shift\") are observed and discussed in\nterms of excitations of the partially or fully polarized hole gas. At large\nspin splitting, and without changing the carrier density, the singlet state of\nthe charged exciton is destabilized in favour of a triplet state configuration\nof holes. The binding energy of the singlet state is thus measured and found to\nbe independent of the carrier density (in contrast with the splitting between\nthe charged exciton and the neutral exciton lines). The state stable at large\nspin splitting is close to the neutral exciton at low carrier density, and\nclose to an uncorrelated electron-hole pair at the largest values of the\ncarrier density achieved. The triplet state gives rise to a characteristic\ndouble-line structure with an indirect transition to the ground state (with a\nstrong phonon replica) and a direct transition to an excited state of the hole\ngas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2004 09:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

We examine the conditions under\nwhich a global temperature can exist for a spacetime with two horizons using\nthe example of Schwarzschild-De Sitter (SDS) spacetime. We systematically\nextend different procedures (like the expectation value of stress tensor,\nresponse of particle detectors, periodicity in the Euclidean time etc.) for\nidentifying a temperature in the case of spacetimes with single horizon to the\nSDS spacetime. This analysis is facilitated by using a global coordinate chart\nwhich covers the entire SDS manifold. We find that all the procedures lead to a\nconsistent picture characterized by the following features: (a) In general, SDS\nspacetime behaves like a non-equilibrium system characterized by two\ntemperatures. (b) It is not possible to associate a global temperature with SDS\nspacetime except when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational (c)\nEven when the ratio of the two surface gravities is rational, the thermal\nnature depends on the coordinate chart used. There exists a global coordinate\nchart in which there is global equilibrium temperature while there exist other\ncharts in which SDS behaves as though it has two different temperatures.

Thus, the investigation of\nthese modes is a timeliness topic.\n  Quasinormal modes dominate almost every process involving black holes, in\nparticular gravitational wave emission during, for example, the collision\nbetween two black holes. It may be possible to create black holes at future\naccelerators, according to recent theories advocating the existence of extra\ndimensions in our universe.
