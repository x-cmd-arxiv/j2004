The derivation\nuses second-order perturbation theory and assumes that the perturbation slowly\ngrows over a very long time: the time-asymptotic limit. This formula has been\nwidely used to predict the angular momentum transport between spiral arms and\nstellar bars between disks and dark-matter halos. However, this paper shows\nthat the LBK time-asymptotic limit is not appropriate because the\ncharacteristic evolution time for galaxies is too close to the relevant\ndynamical times. We demonstrate that transients, not present in the\ntime-asymptotic formula, can play a major role in the evolution for realistic\nastronomical time scales. A generalisation for arbitrary time dependence is\npresented and illustrated by the bar--halo and satellite--halo interaction. The\nnatural time dependence in bar-driven halo evolution causes quantitative\ndifferences in the overall torque and qualitative differences in the physical-\nand phase-space location of angular momentum transfer. The time-dependent\ntheory predicts that four principal resonances dominate the torque at different\ntimes and accurately predicts the results of an N-body simulation. In addition,\nwe show that the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) is responsible for the peak\nangular momentum exchange but, due to the time dependence, the changes occur\nover a broad range of energies, radii and frequencies. We describe the\nimplication of these findings for the satellite--halo interaction using a\nsimple model and end with a discussion of possible impact on other aspects\nsecular galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2004 18:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We estimate the angular power spectrum locally in discs\nof various sizes positioned in different directions. We determine whether the\nspatial position of a few outliers in the angular power spectrum could suggest\nthe presence of residual foregrounds or systematic effects. For multipoles\nclose to the first peak, the most deviant local estimates from the best fit\nWMAP model are associated with a few particular areas close to the Galactic\nplane. Such deviations also include the ``dent'' in the spectrum just shortward\nof the first peak which was remarked upon by the WMAP team. Estimating the\nangular power spectrum excluding these areas gives a slightly higher first\nDoppler peak amplitude. Finally, we probe the isotropy of the largest angular\nscales by estimating the power spectrum on hemispheres and reconfirm strong\nindications of a north-south asymmetry previously reported by other authors. We\nfind tentative evidence for residual foregrounds in the range l=2-4, which\ncould be associated with the low measured quadrupole amplitudes and other\nanomalies on these angular scales. However, over the range l=5-40 the observed\nasymmetry is much harder to explain in terms of residual foregrounds and known\nsystematic effects. Such asymmetric distributions of power on the sky provide a\nserious test for the cosmological principle of isotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2004 15:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-29"}
