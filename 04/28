The composites consist of short pieces of conductive\nferromagnetic microwires embedded into a dielectric matrix. The short wire\ninclusions play a role of the elementary scatterers, when the electromagnetic\nwave irradiates the composite and induces a longitudinal current distribution\nand electrical dipole moment in each inclusion. These induced dipole moments\nform the dipole response, which can be characterized by some complex effective\npermittivity. The later may have a resonance or relaxation dispersion caused by\nthe strong current distribution along a wire, which depends on the wire high\nfrequency surface impedance. In the vicinity of the resonance frequency any\nvariations in the wire surface impedance result in a large change of the\ncurrent distribution, and hence in the dipole moment of each inclusion and the\neffective permittivity on the whole. For a ferromagnetic conductive microwire,\nthe surface impedance may depend not only on its conductivity but also on the\ndc external magnetic field and tension through the so-called magneto-impedance\neffect (MI). Therefore, the dispersion of the effective permittivity can be\ntuned from a resonance type to a relaxation type, when a sufficient magnetic\nfield or tensile stress is applied to the composite sample. A number of\napplications can be proposed, including the stress-sensitive media for remote\nnon-destructive health monitoring of different structures, and selective\nmicrowave coatings with field-dependent reflection/transmission coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2004 14:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2004 10:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2004 17:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 2004 17:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2004 12:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2005 20:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
