One of the major\noutstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by\nnumerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of HII regions during\nthe reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large-scale density\nfluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size\ndistribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of\nionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in\nthe neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from\nthe HII regions that should be observable with the next generation of\nlow-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission\nfrom the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions\nbeyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively\nchanges the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2004 17:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This means that the brightest young cluster in a galaxy can be\npredicted from the total number of young clusters based purely on statistics.\nThis suggests that the physical processes responsible for the formation of\nclusters are similar in a wide variety of galaxies, from mergers to quiescent\nspirals. One possibility is that conditions for making young massive clusters\nare globally present in mergers while only locally present in spirals (i.e., in\nthe spiral arms). However, understanding the destruction of clusters and the\naccompanying survival rates is more important for understanding cluster\ndemographics than understanding their formation. This is because only about 1\nin 1,000 clusters with mass greater than 10^4 M_odot will survive to become an\nold globular cluster. In this paper we briefly review this basic framework and\nthen develop a toy model that allows us to begin to address several fundamental\nquestions. In particular, we demonstrate that young clusters in the Antennae\nGalaxies have a high ``infant mortality'' rate, with roughly 90% of the\nclusters being destroyed each decade of log(time).

Here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the\nblack-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is more\nfundamental to the determination of the clustering length. In particular, the\nclustering length observed in the 2dF quasar redshift survey is consistent with\nthe galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, provided\nthat quasars shine at ~10-100% of their Eddington luminosity. The slow\nevolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2dF quasar\nsurvey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halo\ncircular velocity, rather than halo mass. These results are independent from\nobservations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to\ndetermine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. We show that if\nquasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasars\nimply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host\ngalaxy rather than by the Salpeter time. Our results imply that as the redshift\nincreases, the central black-holes comprise a larger fraction of their host\ngalaxy mass and the quasar lifetime gets shorter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2004 19:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A set of Monte Carlo simulations is used to\ncharacterize the efficacy of the methods. The essence of the first 2 methods is\nto determine, for an assumed value of R_V, the relative visual extinction\ndelta(A_V) of each cluster horizontal branch (HB) star with respect to an\nempirical HB locus; the locus is derived from the CMD of a subset of stars near\nthe cluster center in which differential reddening is small.

This equation is continuous in time and discrete\nin space with lattice translational invariance and has global gauge invariance.\nWhen $\\nu = 0$, it reduces to the famous integrable Ablowitz - Ladik (AL)\nequation. Otherwise it is nonintegrable. The formation of unstaggered and\nstaggered stationary localized states (SLS) in IN-DNLS is studied here using\ndiscrete variational method. The appropriate functional is derived and its\nequivalence to the effective Lagrangian is established. From the physical\nconsideration, the ansatz of SLS is assumed to have the functional form of\nstationary soliton of AL equation. So, the ansatz contains three optimizable\nparameters, defining width ($\\beta^{-1})$, maximum amplitude and its position\n($\\sqrt\\Psi$, $x_{0}$). Four possible situations are considered. An unstaggered\nSLS can be either on-site peaked $(x_{0} = 0.0)$ or inter-site peaked $(x_{0} =\n0.5)$. On the other hand, a staggered SLS can be either Sievers-Takeno (ST)\nlike mode $(x_{0} = 0.0)$, or Page(P) like mode $(x_{0} = 0.5)$. It is shown\nhere that unstable SLS arises due to incomplete consideration of the problem.\nIn the exact calculation, there exists no unstable mode. The width of an\nunstaggered SLS of either type decreases with increasing $\\nu > 0$.\nFurthermore, on-site peaked state is found to be energetically stable. These\nresults are explained using the effective mass picture. For the staggered SLS,\nthe existence of ST like mode and P like mode is shown to be a fundamental\nproperty of a system, described by IN-DNLS. Their properties are also\ninvestigated. For large width and small amplitude SLS, the known asymptotic\nresult for the amplitude is obtained. Further scope and possible extensions of\nthis work are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2004 19:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For example, we show that any test set that detects all\nsingle stuck-at faults in a reversible circuit also detects all multiple\nstuck-at faults. We present efficient test set constructions for the standard\nstuck-at fault model as well as the usually intractable cell-fault model. We\nalso give a practical test set generation algorithm, based on an integer linear\nprogramming formulation, that yields test sets approximately half the size of\nthose produced by conventional ATPG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2004 04:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main advantage of this formalism (clearly\nreminiscent of the idea of ``coherences'' and ``coupling Hamiltonians'' of spin\nsystems) is that the pattern of correlation between qubits and the pattern of\ninfinitesimal correlation are highlighted simultaneously and can be used\nconstructively for qubit manipulation. For example, it allows to compute\nexplicitly a Rodrigues' formula for the one-parameter orbits of nonlocal\nHamiltonians.
