Among the most appealing mechanisms are\nthermal conduction and heating through buoyant gas deposited in the ICM by\nAGNs. We combine Virgo/M87 observations of three satellites (Chandra,\nXMM-Newton and Beppo-SAX) to inspect the dynamics of the ICM in the center of\nthe cluster. Using the spectral deprojection technique, we derive the physical\nquantities describing the ICM and determine the extra-heating needed to balance\nthe cooling flow assuming that thermal conduction operates at a fixed fraction\nof the Spitzer value. We assume that the extra-heating is due to buoyant gas\nand we fit the data using the model developed by Ruszkowski and Begelman\n(2002). We derive a scale radius for the model of $\\sim 5$ kpc, which is\ncomparable with the M87 AGN jet extension, and a required luminosity of the AGN\nof a $few \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the observed AGN\nluminosity. We discuss a scenario where the buoyant bubbles are filled of\nrelativistic particles and magnetic field responsible for the radio emission in\nM87. The AGN is supposed to be intermittent and to inject populations of\nbuoyant bubbles through a succession of outbursts. We also study the X-ray cool\ncomponent detected in the radio lobes and suggest that it is structured in\nblobs which are tied to the radio buoyant bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2004 13:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Particular\nattention is devoted to the classical Heisenberg models, where the state space\nis the d-dimensional unit sphere and the interactions are proportional to the\ncosines of the angles between neighboring spins. The phenomenon of interest\nhere is the classification of phase transition (non-uniqueness of the Gibbs\nstate) according to whether it is robust. In many cases, including all of the\nHeisenberg and Potts models, occurrence of robust phase transition is\ndetermined by the geometry (branching number) of the tree in a way that\nparallels the situation with independent percolation and usual phase transition\nfor the Ising model. The critical values for robust phase transition for the\nHeisenberg and Potts models are also calculated exactly. In some cases, such as\nthe q>=3 Potts model, robust phase transition and usual phase transition do not\ncoincide, while in other cases, such as the Heisenberg models, we conjecture\nthat robust phase transition and usual phase transition are equivalent. In\naddition, we show that symmetry breaking is equivalent to the existence of a\nphase transition, a fact believed but not known for the rotor model on Z^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2004 15:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Statistical power was also assessed for\neach fit coefficient to reflect the proportion of times out of 1000 tests each\ncoefficient was statistically significant, given the induced effect size and\nsample size of the Gaussians.

A natural solution of the above mentioned\nproblem will be proposed in which we give a slightly more general form of QM\nand QFT (in comparison to the ordinary QFT) with noncommutative structure of\nspacetime playing fundamental role in it. We achieve it by reinterpretation of\nthe Bohr's complementarity principle on the one hand and by incorporation of\nour gauge freedom analysis on the other.

It will be given an\nexample involving time dependent gauge freedom describing non-relativistic\nquantum particle in nonrelativistic gravitational field.
