The Heisenberg interactions are\nperiodically arranged in a Villain configuration in two dimensions with\nnearest-neighbor, ferromagnetic coupling $J$ and antiferromagnetic coupling\n$-\\eta J$. This model is solved at zero temperature by performing a\n$1/\\sqrt{S}$ expansion in the rotated reference frame of each local moment.\nWhen $\\eta $ exceeds a critical value, the ground state is a magnetically\nfrustrated, canted antiferromagnet. With increasing hopping energy $t$ or\nmagnetic field $B$, the local moments become aligned and the ferromagnetic\nphase is stabilized above critical values of $t$ or $B$. In the canted phase, a\ncharge-density wave forms because the electrons prefer to sit on lines of sites\nthat are coupled ferromagnetically. Due to a change in the topology of the\nFermi surface from closed to open, phase separation occurs in a narrow range of\nparameters in the canted phase. In zero field, the long-wavelength spin waves\nare isotropic in the region of phase separation. Whereas the average spin-wave\nstiffness in the canted phase increases with $t$ or $\\eta $, it exhibits a more\ncomplicated dependence on field.

We define an integral\nm (r) involving the Zeta function in the complex variable s = r + it and find a\nparticurarly interesting expression for m(r) which is rigorous at least in some\nrange of r. In such a range we find that there are two discontinuities of the\nderivative m'(r) at r = 1 and r = 0, which we calculate exactly. The jump at r\n= 1 is given by 4*Pi, while that at r = 0 is given by (-4 + gamma + 3*log(2) +\nPi/2)*Pi. The validity of the expression for m(r) up to r = 1/2 is equivalent\nto the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Assuming RH the expression for\nm(r) gives m = 0 at r = 1/2 and the slope m'(r) = Pi*(1 + gamma) = 4.95 at r =\n1/2 (where gamma = 0.577215... is the Euler constant). As a consequence, if the\nexpression for m(r) can be continued up to r = 1/2, then if we interpret m(r)\nas the effective potential of a charged filament, in the presence of the unit\ncharges located at all the zeros (trivial and non trivial zeros) and at the\npole in one of the Riemann Zeta function then there is a jump of the electric\nfield E(r) = m'(r) at r = 1/2 given by 2*Pi times the first Li's coefficient\nlambda_1 = [1+gamma/2-(1/2)ln(4*Pi)] = 0.0230957.

In 1983, J.K. Moser and S.M.

On the contrary, it appears that\nsuch a nonconvergence phenomenon does not appear for submanifolds of C^n whose\nCR dimension is locally constant, in view of recent results by S.M. Baouendi,\nP. Ebenfelt and L.P. Rothschild. These results hold true with hypotheses which\nare relatively simple, but satisfied at a Zariski-generic. Notably, these\nauthors establish that every invertible formal CR mapping between two\nsubmanifolds of C^n which are real analytic, generic, finitely nondegenerate\nand minimal (in the sense of J.-M.

This result may be interpreted as a formal Schwarz\nreflection principle for CR mappings. We deduce that every formal CR\nequivalence between two submanifolds of C^n which are real analytic, generic\nand minimal is convergent if and only if both submanifolds are holomorphically\nnondegenerate (in the sense of N.

Unitary transformations are central to all quantum\ncomputational algorithms. Many realizations of quantum computation use a\nsubmanifold of states, comprising the quantum register, coupled by an external\ndriving field to a collection of additional mediating excited states. Previous\nattempts to apply control theory to induce unitary transformations on the\nquantum register, while successful, produced pulses that drive the population\nout of the computational register at intermediate times. Leakage of population\nfrom the register is undesirable since often the states outside the register\nare prone to decay and decoherence, and populating them causes a decrease in\nthe final fidelity. In this work we devise a local optimal control method for\nachieving target unitary transformations on a quantum register, while avoiding\nintermediate leakage out of the computational submanifold. The technique\nexploits a phase locking of the field to the system such as to eliminate the\nundesirable excitation. This method is then applied to produce an SU(6) Fourier\ntransform on the vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of the\nNa$_2$ molecule. The emerging mechanism uses two photon resonances to create a\ntransformation on the quantum register while blocking one photon resonances to\nexcited states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2004 12:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
