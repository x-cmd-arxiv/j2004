Asymptotic scaling arguments justifying the\nshearing box approximation are systematically derived, showing that there exist\ntwo limits which we call small shearing box (SSB) and large shearing box (LSB).\nThe physical meaning of these two limits and their relationship to model\nequations implemented by previous investigators are discussed briefly. Two\ndimensional (2D) dynamics of the SSB are explored and shown to contain\ntransiently growing (TG) linear modes, whose nature is first discussed within\nthe context of linear theory. The fully nonlinear regime in 2D is investigated\nnumerically for very high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Solutions exhibiting sustained\ndynamics are found and manifest episodic but recurrent TG behavior and these\nare associated with the formation and long-term survival of coherent vortices.\nThe life-time of this spatio-temporal complexity depends on the Re number and\nthe strength and nature of the initial disturbance. We show results for a case\nin which the dynamical activity persists for the entire duration of the\nsimulation (hundreds of box orbits). Some combinations of the Re number and the\ninitial perturbation spectrum (and strength) show the transiently growing\nphenomenon to ultimately fade away or, in some instances, to be absent\naltogether. Because the SSB approximation used here is equivalent to a 2D\nincompressible flow, the dynamics can not depend on the Coriolis force.\nTherefore, three dimensional (3D) simulations are needed in order to decide if\nthis force indeed suppresses nonlinear hydrodynamical instability in\nrotationally supported disks in the shearing box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2004 18:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2004 10:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We have used both low resolution (R ~ 800) observations of the Brackett\nlines from Brg, to Br24, and medium resolution (R~9000) spectra of the Brg,\nBr12 and Br13 lines. The dereddened fluxes indicates that the lines remain\nmoderately thick up to high quantum numbers. Moreover, the profiles of the\nthree lines observed in medium resolution are all broad and nearly symmetric,\nwith a trend for the lines at high n-number to be narrower than the Brg, line.\nWith the assumption that the three lines have different optical depths and\nconsequently trace zones at different physical depths, we interprete the\nobserved profiles as evidence that the ionized gas velocity in the HI emitting\nregion is increasing as we move outwards, as expected in an accelerating wind\nmore than in an infalling gas. We have modelled the observed line ratios and\nvelocities with a simplified model for the HI excitation in an expanding\ncircumstellar gas. Such a comparison indicates that the observations are\nconsistent with the emission coming from a very compact region of 4-6 solar\nradii, where the gas has been already accelerated to velocities of the order of\n200 \\kms, with an associated mass flow rate of the ionized component of the\norder of 10^{-7} solar masses per year. This implies that the observed lines\nshould originate either from a stellar wind or from the inner part of a disk\nwind, providing that the disk inner truncation radius is close to the stellar\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 10:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Any real system emergence, structure, and\nbehaviour can be expressed now by the universal law of conservation, or\nsymmetry, of complexity that unifies extended versions of any (correct)\nsymmetry, law, or \"principle\". Both the observed world structure and its\nunreduced dynamics result from that universal, unique symmetry, instead of\nformal imposition of separated, broken and simplified symmetries upon the\nexisting, postulated structures in the unitary world \"model\". Whereas any\nunitary \"symmetry\" is regular and therefore practically always \"spontaneously\nbroken\" (violated) in the real world dynamics, the universal symmetry of\ncomplexity remains always exact, but unites different, irregular, dynamically\nnonlinear, and intrinsically unstable patterns of unreduced world structure. It\nalso provides the rigorous, dynamically derived expression of the ``arrow of\ntime\" (generalised entropy growth law) applicable to any real, necessarily\ncomplex system, from elementary particle to the universe. Particular\napplications of the universal symmetry of complexity, from fundamental physics\nto biology and theory of consciousness, provide old mysteries solutions and new\nresearch perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2004 19:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
