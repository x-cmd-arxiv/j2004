Using the MDM\n2.4m telescope we obtain upper limits in the optical at the position of the\npoint source, (J2000) 00h07m01.56s, +73o03'08.1\", determined to an accuracy of\n0.1\", of B>25.4, V>24.8, R>25.1, and I>23.7; these correspond to an\nX-ray-to-optical flux ratio >100. Neither a VLA image at 1425 MHz, nor a deep\npulsar search at 820 MHz using the NRAO Green Bank Telescope, reveal a radio\npulsar counterpart to an equivalent luminosity limit at 1400 MHz of 0.02 mJy\nkpc^2, which is equal to the lowest luminosity known for any radio pulsar. The\nChandra point source accounts for about 30% of the flux of RX J0007.0+7303,\nwhile its compact nebula plus jet comprise about 70%. The X-ray spectrum of the\npoint source is fitted with a power-law plus blackbody model with Gamma =\n1.6+/-0.6, kT_{infty} = 0.13+/-0.05 keV, and R_infty = 0.37 km, values typical\nof a young pulsar. An upper limit of T^{infty}_e < 6.6x10^5 K to the effective\ntemperature of the entire neutron star surface is derived, which is one of the\nmost constraining data points on cooling models. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity of\nRX J0007.0+7303 is 4x10^{31}(d/1.4 kpc)^2 ergs s^{-1}, but the larger ~18'\ndiameter synchrotron nebula in which it is embedded is two orders of magnitude\nmore luminous. These properties allow us to estimate, albeit crudely, that the\nspin-down luminosity of the underlying pulsar is in the range 10^{36}-10^{37}\nergs s^{-1}, and support the identification of the high-energy gamma-ray source\n3EG J0010+7309 as a pulsar even though its spin parameters have not yet been\ndetermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2004 18:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nredshifted soft X-ray background from these early sources produces:(i) fully\nionised atomic hydrogen in the low density intergalactic medium before redshift\nz~7 (consequently stellar reionisation is characterised by an instantaneous\noverlap phase of HII regions),(ii) a second HeII reionisation at z~3 and (iii)\nheats the intergalactic medium to near 10000 K at low redshifts.

Yet vertices, for example, the\nindividuals living in society, usually are not able to find the shortest paths,\ndue to the very serious limit of information. To theoretically study this\nissue, here the navigation process of launching messages toward designated\ntargets is investigated on a variant of the one-dimensional small-world network\n(SWN). In the network structure considered, the probability of a shortcut\nfalling between a pair of nodes is proportional to $r^{-\\alpha}$, where $r$ is\nthe lattice distance between the nodes. When $\\alpha =0$, it reduces to the SWN\nmodel with random shortcuts. The system shows the dynamic small-world (SW)\neffect, which is different from the well-studied static SW effect.

This picture is motivated by a\npromising recent attempt (hep-th/0304256) to naturally understand the observed\ndark energy density, and this connection with dark energy prevents making the\nextra dimensions smaller than of order 5 $\\mu$m. The resulting inability to\nchange this size makes the model very predictive, and easily falsifiable within\nthe near future. Being supersymmetric, it may plausibly be embedded into a more\nfundamental theory such as string theory, in which case an additional 4 compact\ndimensions may also be present having inverse radii at the TeV scale or higher.\nThe model is close to, but consistent with, current experimental constraints.\nWe outline possible phenomenological implications for particle physics (both at\naccelerators and elsewhere), for precision tests of gravity, for astrophysics\nand for cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2004 12:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2004 13:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The image of g has been a subject of recent interest; it is\nthe positive part of the tropical algebraic variety which parameterizes\nn-tuples of points on a tropical line in m-space.\n  The domains of linearity of g are the regions of the real hyperplane\narrangement A_{m,n}, corresponding to the complete bipartite graph K_{m,n}. We\nexplain how the images of (some of) the regions provide two polyhedral\nsubdivisions of the image of g, one of which is a refinement of the other. The\nfiner subdivision is particularly nice enumeratively: it has 2 {m \\choose 2} {n\n\\choose 2} r_{m-2,n-2} maximum-dimensional cells, where r_{m-2,n-2} is the\nnumber of regions of the arrangement A_{m-2,n-2}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2004 02:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is also known that it is possible to write down\nsets of ``super-quantum'' correlations that are more non-local than is allowed\nby quantum mechanics, yet are still non-signalling. Viewed as an information\ntheoretic resource, super-quantum correlations are very powerful at reducing\nthe amount of communication needed for distributed computational tasks. An\nintriguing question is why quantum mechanics does not allow these more powerful\ncorrelations. We aim to shed light on the range of quantum possibilities by\nplacing them within a wider context. With this in mind, we investigate the set\nof correlations that are constrained only by the no-signalling principle. These\ncorrelations form a polytope, which contains the quantum correlations as a\n(proper) subset. We determine the vertices of the no-signalling polytope in the\ncase that two observers each choose from two possible measurements with d\noutcomes.
