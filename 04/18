A timing analysis of these data reveals a photometric\nperiod of 0.3205 +/- 0.0007 days (i.e. 7.63 hr) with a possible alias at 0.3785\ndays (9.12 hr). Our photometry completely rules out the previously published\nspectroscopic period of 0.212 days (5.09 hr). Consequently, we reanalyzed the\n15 archival ESO/VLT spectra (obtained 2002 June by Sanchez-Fernandez et al.)\nthat were the basis of the previously published spectroscopic period. We used a\n``restframe search'' technique that is well suited for cases when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. The results confirmed the\nphotometric period of 0.3205 days, and rule out the alias period near 0.38\ndays. The best value for the velocity semiamplitude of the companion star is\nK_2 = 435 +/- 30 km/sec, and the corresponding optical mass function is f(M) =\n2.73 +/- 0.56 solar masses. The amplitude of the phased R-band light curve is\n0.2 magnitudes, which gives a lower limit to the inclination of 50 +/- 3\ndegrees in the limiting case of no contribution to the R-band light curve from\nthe accretion disk. If the mass ratio of XTE J1650-500 is similar to the mass\nratios of other black hole binaries like A0620-00 or GRS 1124-683 (e.g. Q >~\n10), then our lower limit to the inclination gives an upper limit to the mass\nof the black hole in XTE J1650-500 of M_1 <~ 7.3 solar masses. However, the\nmass can be considerably lower if the R-band flux is dominated by the accretion\ndisk. For example, if the accretion disk does contribute 80% of the flux, as\nour preliminary results suggest, then the black hole mass would be only about 4\nsolar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2004 23:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2004 00:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Specifically, this model\nconsists of a Lie algebroid, equipped with an affine connection compatible with\nthe Lie algebroid structure. The curvature of this connection vanishes\nprecisely when the structure is locally symmetric.\n  This model generalizes Cartan geometries, a substantial class, to the\nintransitive case. Simple examples are surveyed and corresponding local\nobstructions to symmetry are identified. These examples include foliations,\nRiemannian structures, infinitesimal G-structures, symplectic and Poisson\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2004 23:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2005 01:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

The GSI and Weizmann\ndata are in good agreement with the Seattle data at high energies, but at low\nenergies we observe a slight systematic (up to 2sigma) deviation, yet the\nSeattle group repeatedly rejects the CD method. We show that when plotting the\nslopes, they mis plotted one CD data point and exclude measured slopes that\ncontradict their claim. Indeed the measured slope is essential to elucidate the\nd-wave correction to S17(0) that could be as large as 15%, and is the last open\nquestion that needs to be resolved before S17(0) can be quoted with an accuracy\nof 5% or better. We show that this goal has not been achieved (in spite of the\nstrong claim of the Seattle group), since currently there is no agreement among\nexperiments as well as among theoretical models on the value of the slope. In\naddition, currently there is no theoretical framework within which (for example\nthe Seattle) data can be analyzed and S17(0) extrapolated with the claimed high\nprecision of 2.5%. This (last) issue of the slope and the d-wave correction\nmust be resolved (by future measurements) so as to allow quoting S17(0) with an\naccuracy of 5% or better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2004 20:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Additionally, they can\nbe confined by an external field and/or they can interact with one another. The\nexternal field may actually be an attractive marker, for example a light field\n(as in the experiment) or an energy potential or a chemical gradient (as in the\ntheory). The potential energy can also be the result of interparticle\nattractive and/or repulsive forces summed over all particles (a mean field\npotential). Four, qualitatively different motions of the particles are\npossible: at small particle density their motions are approximately independent\nof one another subject only to the external field and the noise, which results\nin moving randomly through or performing rotational motions about a central\npoint in space. At increasing densities interactions play an important role and\nindividuals form a swarm performing several types of self-organized collective\nmotion. We apply this model for the description of zooplankton Daphnia swarms.\nIn the case of the zooplankton Daphnia (and probably many other aquatic animals\nthat form similar motions as well) this vortex is hydrodynamical but motivated\nby the self-propelled motion of the individuals. Similar vortex-type motions\nhave been observed for other creatures ranging in size from bacteria to flocks\nof birds and schools of fish. However, our experiment with Daphnia is unique in\nthat all four motions can be observed in controlled laboratory conditions with\nthe same animal. Moreover, the theory, presented in both continuous\ndifferential equation and random walk forms, offers a quantitative, physically\nbased explanation of the four motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2004 15:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2004 14:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
