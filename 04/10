Observations of K-band near-infrared and\nmulti-transition CS and N2H+ millimeter line emission are shown in relation to\na sub-millimeter map of the cool dust around the most embedded stars. The\nnear-infrared emission is offset from the dust peak suggesting a shift in the\nlocation of star formation over the history of the core. The CS emission is\nconcentrated toward the core center but N2H+ peaks in two main cores offset\nfrom the center, opposite to the chemistry observed in low mass cores. A\nstarless core with strong CS but weak N2H+ emission is found toward the western\nedge of the region. The average CS(2-1) spectrum over the cluster forming core\nis asymmetrically self-absorbed suggesting infall.

The utility of non-covalently bonded films is\nlimited because they are mechanically unstable and consist of poorly connected\ndomains. Consequently, charge transfers in these films are limited to the\ndistances in the order of a micrometer. Here we show that a recently developed\ngas phase assembling method (Burtman, V., Zelichenok, A., Yitzchaik, S. (1999)\nAngewandte Chemie Inter. Ed. 38, 2041-2045.), which produces robust dense\nmonolayers of NTCDI covalently attached to the surface of silicon, allows one\nto overcome this scale limitation. These virtually insulating monolayers can be\nphoto-chemically populated with cation-radicals via ejection of electrons into\nthe semi-conducting base. The positive charges of cation-radicals can migrate\nas far as several millimeters within microseconds in a random walk fashion thus\ndemonstrating the macroscopic connectivity of the film. Since the charges exist\nas cation-radicals, which are potent oxidants, their migration is coupled to\ntransfer of the free energy of their reduction and is driven by the redox\npotential gradient. Reduction of cation-radicals by an anode converts this free\nenergy into electromotive force. We show how these films can be implemented in\nsolar energy conversion and basic time-resolved distance-controlled studies of\nsequences of ultra-fast electron transfers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2004 21:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Electrical and thermal transport in these mesoscopic\nsystems typically involves wave propagation through a nanoscale geometry such\nas a quantum wire. In this paper we present a general theoretical technique to\ndescribe wave propagation through a curved wire of uniform cross-section and\nlying in a plane, but of otherwise arbitrary shape. The method consists of (i)\nintroducing a local orthogonal coordinate system, the arclength and two locally\nperpendicular coordinate axes, dictated by the shape of the wire; (ii)\nrewriting the wave equation of interest in this system; (iii) identifying an\neffective scattering potential caused by the local curvature; and (iv), solving\nthe associated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattering matrix. We carry\nout this procedure in detail for the scalar Helmholtz equation with both\nhard-wall and stress-free boundary conditions, appropriate for the mesoscopic\ntransport of electrons and (scalar) phonons. A novel aspect of the phonon case\nis that the reflection probability always vanishes in the long-wavelength\nlimit, allowing a simple perturbative (Born approximation) treatment at low\nenergies. Our results show that, in contrast to charge transport, curvature\nonly barely suppresses thermal transport, even for sharply bent wires, at least\nwithin the two-dimensional scalar phonon model considered.

Such a method is unsuitable for\nthe studies of electron trapping dynamics of quasifree electrons per se. We\ndemonstrate that the PPC method can be extended to study such dynamics,\nprovided that the time resolution of the conductivity setup is better than the\nratio mu[e_qf]tau[e_qf]/mu[e_trap] of the mobility-lifetime product for the\nquasifree electron and the mobility of the trapped electron. For some liquids\n(e.g., supercritical CO2) this time is sufficiently long (> 100 ns) and the\nstandard conductivity equipment can be used. Even if the time resolution cannot\nbe increased (due to the adverse effect on the sensitivity), the trapping\ndynamics can be studied provided that the trapping competes with cross\nrecombination of quasifree electrons with holes in the solvent bulk. Since the\nmobility of these quasifree electrons is very large (10-10^3 cm^2/Vs), this\nrecombination is facile even when the density of ionization events is fairly\nlow (< 1 mM).

We study side chain effects using\nsquare lattice and tetrahedral lattice models, with explicitly side chains of\ntwo atoms. We distinguish effects due to chirality and effects due to side\nchain flexibilities, since residues in proteins are L-residues, and their side\nchains adopt different rotameric states. Short chains are enumerated\nexhaustively. For long chains, we sample effectively rare events (eg, compact\nconformations) and obtain complete pictures of ensemble properties of these\nmodels at all compactness region. We find that both chirality and reduced side\nchain flexibility lower the folding entropy significantly for globally compact\nconformations, suggesting that they are important properties of residues to\nensure fast folding and stable native structure. This corresponds well with our\nfinding that natural amino acid residues have reduced effective flexibility, as\nevidenced by analysis of rotamer libraries and side chain rotatable bonds. We\nfurther develop a method calculating the exact side-chain entropy for a given\nback bone structure. We show that simple rotamer counting often underestimates\nside chain entropy significantly, and side chain entropy does not always\ncorrelate well with main chain packing. Among compact backbones with maximum\nside chain entropy, helical structures emerges as the dominating\nconfigurations.
