At large values of the mean shear rate,\nthe Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) limit is approached. Analytical solutions are\nfound for the inviscid compressible RDT equations at long times. The RDT\nequations are also solved numerically for both inviscid and viscous cases. The\nRDT solutions, confirmed by the DNS results, show that the even order\ntransverse derivative moments of the dilatational and solenoidal velocity\nfields are anisotropic, with the dilatational motions more anisotropic than\ntheir solenoidal counterparts. The results obtained for the incompressible case\nare similar to those obtained for the solenoidal motions in the compressible\ncase.

Although the anisotropy decreases with Reynolds\nnumber, it is likely that for higher even order moments it will persist at\nlarge values of the Reynolds number, in contrast with the postulate of local\nisotropy.

Here we present a model of nucleotide substitution that\ncombines new theory on metabolic rate with the now classic neutral theory of\nmolecular evolution. The model quantitatively predicts rate heterogeneity, and\nreconciles differences in molecular- and fossil-estimated dates of evolutionary\nevents. Model predictions are supported by extensive data from mitochondrial\nand nuclear genomes. By accounting for the effects of body size and temperature\non metabolic rate, a single molecular clock explains heterogeneity in rates of\nnucleotide substitution in different genes, taxa, and thermal environments.\nThis model suggests that there is indeed a general molecular clock, as\noriginally proposed by Zuckerkandl and Pauling, but that it ticks at a constant\nsubstitution rate per unit mass-specific metabolic energy rather than per unit\ntime. More generally, the model suggests that body size and temperature combine\nto control the overall rate of evolution through their effects on metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2004 19:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, this is just one gene. It is known that horizontal gene transfer\ncan occur between bacterial species, although the frequency and implications of\nthis are not fully understood. If horizontal transfer were frequent, there\nwould be no single evolutionary tree for bacteria because each gene would\nfollow a different tree. We carried out phylogenetic analyses of rRNA and tRNA\ngenes from Proteobacteria (a diverse group for which many complete genome\nsequences are available) using RNA-specific phylogenetic methods that account\nfor the conservation of the secondary structure. We compared trees for 16S rRNA\nand 23S rRNA with those derived from concatenated alignments of 29 tRNA genes\nthat are found in all the genomes studied. The tRNA genes are scattered\nthroughout the genomes, and would not follow the same evolutionary history if\nhorizontal transfer were frequent. Nevertheless, the tRNA tree is consistent\nwith the rRNA tree in most respects. Minor differences can almost all be\nattributed to uncertainty or unreliability of the phylogenetic method. We\ntherefore conclude that tRNA genes give a coherent picture of the phylogeny of\nthe organisms, and that horizontal transfer of tRNAs is too rare to obscure the\nsignal of the organismal tree. Some tRNA genes are not present in all the\ngenomes. We discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns of presence\nand absence of genes: these involve gene deletion, gene duplication, and\nmutations in the tRNA anticodons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2004 14:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\npresent study we use the complete set of tRNA and rRNA sequences from 69\ncomplete mammalian mitochondrial genomes. The likelihood calculation uses two\nevolutionary models simultaneously for different parts of the sequence: a\npaired-site model for the paired sites and a single-site model for the unpaired\nsites.
