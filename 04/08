This view is realized primarily by employing the terms\nof a typed lambda calculus as representational devices and by using a richer\nform of unification for probing their structures. These additions have\nimportant meta-programming applications but they also pose non-trivial\nimplementation problems. One issue concerns the machine representation of\nlambda terms suitable to their intended use: an adequate encoding must\nfacilitate comparison operations over terms in addition to supporting the usual\nreduction computation. Another aspect relates to the treatment of a unification\noperation that has a branching character and that sometimes calls for the\ndelaying of the solution of unification problems. A final issue concerns the\nexecution of goals whose structures become apparent only in the course of\ncomputation. These various problems are exposed in this paper and solutions to\nthem are described. A satisfactory representation for lambda terms is developed\nby exploiting the nameless notation of de Bruijn as well as explicit encodings\nof substitutions.

Different parametrizations of the long-range\ncorrelations have been also studied. The two-dimensional shape of the source\nhas been investigated in the longitudinal co-moving frame.

A weak dependence of both radius and\nchaoticity on multiplicity and hadronic energy is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2004 13:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here we propose\nthat, all particles are excitation waves of the vacuum and different particles\nare represented by different excitation modes.

In addition, tunneling can be activated by employing\nRaman transitions, thus creating an effective Hamiltonian that does not\npreserve the number of atoms of each species. In the presence of external\nelectromagnetic fields, resulting in complex tunneling couplings, we obtain\neffective Hamiltonians that break chiral symmetry. The ground states of these\nHamiltonians can be used for the physical implementation of geometrical or\ntopological objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2004 18:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2004 13:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

There are\ntwo ways to approach this question. The first is dynamic: the coupling of a\nlarge object to its environment cause any entanglement to decrease\nconsiderably. The second approach, which is discussed in this paper, puts the\nstress on the difficulty to observe a large scale entanglement. As the number\nof particles n grows we need an ever more precise knowledge of the state, and\nan ever more carefully designed experiment, in order to recognize entanglement.\nTo develop this point we consider a family of observables, called witnesses,\nwhich are designed to detect entanglement. A witness W distinguishes all the\nseparable (unentangled) states from some entangled states. If we normalize the\nwitness W to satisfy |tr(W\\rho)| \\leq 1 for all separable states \\rho, then the\nefficiency of W depends on the size of its maximal eigenvalue in absolute\nvalue; that is, its operator norm ||W||. It is known that there are witnesses\non the space of n qbits for which ||W|| is exponential in n. However, we\nconjecture that for a large majority of n-qbit witnesses ||W|| \\leq O(\\sqrt{n\nlogn}). Thus, in a non ideal measurement, which includes errors, the largest\neigenvalue of a typical witness lies below the threshold of detection. We prove\nthis conjecture for the family of extremal witnesses introduced by Werner and\nWolf (Phys. Rev. A 64, 032112 (2001)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2004 09:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2004 10:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2004 11:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2006 17:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
