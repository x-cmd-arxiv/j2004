When applied to an extensive two-dimensional grid of core radii and\nfluid element sizes for each of several time slices of a number of\nproto-supernovae, we find no evidence for the neutron finger instability as\ndescribed by the Livermore group. We find, instead, that the rate of lepton\nequilibration always exceeds that of thermal equilibration. Furthermore, we\nfind that thermal diffusion driven by a lepton fraction difference and lepton\ndiffusion driven by an entropy difference are both nonzero and that the first\nof these tends to be large in magnitude. An important consequence of this is\nthe presence of a doubly diffusive instability, which we refer to as\n``lepto-entropy fingers,'' in an extensive region below the neutrinosphere\nwhere the lepton number, $Y_{\\ell}$, is small. This instability is driven by a\nmechanism very different from that giving rise to neutron fingers, and may play\nan important role in enhancing the neutrino emission. Deep in the core where\nthe entropy is low and the lepton number higher, our analysis indicates a\nregion unstable to another instability which we refer to as ``lepto-entropy\nsemiconvection.''

Provided the observed synchrotron emission is generated by a\nCRe population originating from hadronic interactions of CRp with the ambient\nthermal gas of the intra-cluster medium, the parameter space of the classical\nscenario can be tightened by means of the hadronic minimum energy criterion.\nFor both approaches, we derive the theoretically expected tolerance regions for\nthe inferred minimum energy densities.

In this paper, we review the properties of double wall carbon\nnanotubes (DWCNTs). In particular, it is shown that SWCNT encapsulating\nC$_{60}$, so-called peapods, are transformed into DWCNTs when subject to a high\ntemperature treatment. The inner tubes are grown in a catalyst free environment\nand do not suffer from impurities or defects that are usually encountered for\nas-grown SWCNTs or DWCNTs. As a consequence, the inner tubes are grown with a\nhigh degree of perfection as deduced from the unusually narrow radial breathing\nmode (RBM) lines. This apostrophizes the interior of the SWCNTs as a nano-clean\nroom. The mechanism of the inner nanotube production from C$_{60}$ is\ndiscussed. We also report recent studies aimed at the simplification and\nindustrial scaling up of the DWCNT production process utilizing a low\ntemperature peapod synthesis method. A splitting of the RBMs of inner tubes is\nobserved. This is related to the interaction between the two shells of the\nDWCNTs as the same inner tube type can be encapsulated in different outer ones.\nThe sharp appearance of the inner tube RBMs allows a reliable assignment of the\ntube modes to (n,m) indexes and thus provides a precise determination of the\nrelation between the tube diameter and the RBM frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2004 17:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

To cope with these data rates\na large PC cluster system is being designed to scale to several 1000 nodes,\nconnected by a fast network. For the software that will run on these nodes a\nflexible data transport and distribution software framework, described in this\nthesis, has been developed. The framework consists of a set of separate\ncomponents, that can be connected via a common interface. This allows to\nconstruct different configurations for the HLT, that are even changeable at\nruntime. To ensure a fault-tolerant operation of the HLT, the framework\nincludes a basic fail-over mechanism that allows to replace whole nodes after a\nfailure. The mechanism will be further expanded in the future, utilizing the\nruntime reconnection feature of the framework's component interface. To connect\ncluster nodes a communication class library is used that abstracts from the\nactual network technology and protocol used to retain flexibility in the\nhardware choice. It contains already two working prototype versions for the TCP\nprotocol as well as SCI network adapters. Extensions can be added to the\nlibrary without modifications to other parts of the framework. Extensive tests\nand measurements have been performed with the framework. Their results as well\nas conclusions drawn from them are also presented in this thesis.
