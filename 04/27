In agreement with previous\ninvestigations,we find that when the ram pressure stripping does not disrupt\nthe ISM, it usually has a negligible effect on the galactic wind dynamics. Only\nwhen the IGM ram pressure is comparable to the central ISM thermal pressure the\nstripping and the superwind influence each other increasing the gas removal\nrate. In this case several parameters regulate the ISM ejection process, as the\noriginal distribution of the ISM and the geometry of the IGM-galaxy\ninteraction. When the ISM is not removed by the ram pressure or the wind, it\nloses memory of the starburst episode and recovers almost its pre-burst\ndistribution in a timescale of 50-200 Myr. After this time another star\nformation episode becomes, in principle, possible. Evidently, galactic winds\nare consistent with a recurrent bursts star formation history.\n  Contrary to the ISM content, the amount of the metal-rich ejecta retained by\nthe galaxy is more sensitive to the ram pressure action. Part of the ejecta is\nfirst trapped in a low density, extraplanar gas produced by the IGM-ISM\ninteraction, and then pushed back onto the galactic disc. The amount of trapped\nmetals in a moving galaxy may be up to three times larger than in a galaxy at\nrest. This prediction may be tested comparing metallicity of dwarf galaxies in\nnearby poor clusters or groups, such as Virgo or Fornax, with the field\ncounterpart.

The eight best candidates, L1355, L1498, L1521F,\nL1544, L158, L492, L694-2, and L1155C-1, each show at least four indications of\ninfall asymmetry and no counter-indications. Fits of the spectra to a 2-layer\nradiative transfer model in ten infall candidates suggest that the median\neffective line-of-sight speed of the inward-moving gas is ~0.07 km/s for CS\n(3-2) and ~0.04 km/s for CS(2-1). Considering that the optical depth obtained\nfrom the fits is usually smaller in CS(3-2) than in (2-1) line, this may imply\nthat CS(3-2) usually traces inner denser gas in higher inward motions than\nCS(2-1). However, it is also possible that this conclusion is not\nrepresentative of all starless core infall candidates, due to the statistically\nsmall number analyzed here. Further line observations will be useful to test\nthis conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2004 02:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

One of these is the\nblack ring horizon with $S^1\\times S^{D-3}$ topology where $D$ is the spacetime\ndimension number. In this paper, we investigate the black ring horizon\nformation in systems with $n$-particles. We analyze two kinds of system: the\nhigh-energy $n$-particle system and the momentarily-static $n$-black-hole\ninitial data. In the high-energy particle system, we prove that the black ring\nhorizon does not exist at the instant of collision for any $n$. But there\nremains a possibility that the black ring forms after the collision and this\nresult is not sufficient. Because calculating the metric of this system after\nthe collision is difficult, we consider the momentarily-static $n$-black-hole\ninitial data that can be regarded as a simplified $n$-particle model and\nnumerically solve the black ring horizon that surrounds all the particles. Our\nresults show that there is the minimum particle number that is necessary for\nthe black ring formation and this number depends on $D$. Although many particle\nnumber is required in five-dimensions, $n=4$ is sufficient for the black ring\nformation in the $D\\ge 7$ cases. The black ring formation becomes easier for\nlarger $D$. We provide a plausible physical interpretation of our results and\ndiscuss the validity of Ida and Nakao's conjecture for the horizon formation in\nhigher-dimensions. Finally we briefly discuss the probable methods of producing\nthe black rings in accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2004 04:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
