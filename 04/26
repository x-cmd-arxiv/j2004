By assuming that the vector field generating the symmetry is\nnon-static, the general solution of the field equations on the brane can be\nobtained in an exact parametric form, with the conformal factor taken as\nparameter. As a physical application of the obtained solutions we consider the\nbehavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular\norbit. In this case the tangential velocity can be expressed as a function of\nthe conformal factor and some integration constants only. For a specific range\nof the integration constants, the tangential velocity of the test particle\ntends, in the limit of large radial distances, to a constant value. This\nbehavior is specific to the galactic rotation curves, and is explained usually\nby invoking the hypothesis of the dark matter. The limiting value of the\nangular velocity of the test particle can be obtained as a function of the\nbaryonic mass and radius of the galaxy. The behavior of the dark radiation and\ndark pressure terms is also considered in detail, and it is shown that they can\nbe expressed in terms of the rotational velocity of a test particle. Hence all\nthe predictions of the present model can be tested observationally.

It is shown that by introducing a spin gauge field a particle with\na spin can be described as a spin multiplet of scalar particles situated in a\nnon-Abelian pure gauge (forceless) field U(n). As the result, one can create a\ntheory of particle evolution that is gauge invariant with regards to the group\nU^n(1). Due to this, in the adiabatic (Abelian) approximation the spin gauge\nfield is an analogue of n electromagnetic fields U(1) on the extended phase\nspace of the particle. These fields are force ones, and the forces of their\naction enter the particle motion equations that are derived in the paper in the\ngeneral form. The motion equations describe the topological spin transport,\npumping and splitting.
