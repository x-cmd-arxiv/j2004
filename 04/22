A question naturally arises which is of interest to physics both on\n\"purely\" theoretical and on practical, computational grounds. Is it possible to\napprehend the global pattern underlying integer partition sequences and to\nexpress the global pattern compactly, in the form of a \"matrix\" giving all of\nthe partitions of N into exactly M parts? This paper demonstrates that the\nglobal structure of integer partitions sequences (IPS) is that of a complex\ntree. By analyzing the structure of this tree, we derive a closed form\nexpression for a map from (N, M) to the set of all partitions of a positive\ninteger N into exactly M positive integer summands without regard to order. The\nderivation is based on the use of modular arithmetic to solve an isomorphic\ncombinatoric problem, that of describing the global organization of the\nsequence of all ordered placements of N indistinguishable balls into M\ndistinguishable non-empty bins or boxes.
