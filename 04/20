We find that a range of physical\nparameters, in particular dust temperature and gas temperature, but not so much\ndust surface composition, influence the formation rate of H$_2$. The H$_2$\nformation rate is found to be suppressed above gas kinetic temperatures of a\nfew hundred K and for dust temperatures above 200-300 K and below 10 K. We\nhighlight the differences between our treatment of the H$_2$ formation process\nand other descriptions in the literature. We also study the relative importance\nof H$_2$ formation on dust grains with respect to molecular hydrogen formation\nin the gas phase, through the H$^-$ route. The ratio of formation rates of\nthese two routes depends to a large part on the dust abundance, on the electron\nabundance, and also on the relative strength of the FUV (extra-)galactic\nradiation field. We find that for a cosmological evolution of the star\nformation rate and dust density consistent with the Madau plot, a positive\nfeedback effect on the abundance of H$_2$ due to the presence of dust grains\ncan occur at redshifts $z\\ge 3$. This effect occurs for a dust-to-gas mass\nratio as small as 10$^{-3}$ of the galactic value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2004 16:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Cooling leads to the condensation of gas\nin the inner regions of clusters, which in turn leads to steepening of the dark\nmatter profile. The cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from the\nouter regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the cluster\ncore. The magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the current\nsimulations because they suffer from the overcooling problem: a much larger\nfraction of baryons is in the form of cold gas and stars than is observed. We\nfind that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem.\nAdditional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simple\nuniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delays\nthe bulk of star formation until z<1. Our analysis shows that the overcooling\nin a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in the central galaxy and its\nprogenitors at high redshifts. This indicates that an additional heating\nmechanism that can continuously heat the gas in the cluster core is required to\nreproduce the observed cluster properties.

First, to provide an empirical calibration of near--IR\nSBFs, given that existing stellar population synthesis models are particularly\ndiscrepant in the near--IR. Second, whereas most previous SBF studies have\nfocused on old, metal rich populations, this is the first application to a\nsystem with such a wide range of ages (~ 10^6 to more than 10^10 yr, i.e., 4\norders of magnitude), at the same time that the clusters have a very narrow\nrange of metallicities (Z ~ 0.0006 -- 0.01, ie., 1 order of magnitude only).\nSince stellar population synthesis models predict a more complex sensitivity of\nSBFs to metallicity and age in the near--IR than in the optical, this analysis\noffers a unique way of disentangling the effects of age and metallicity. We\nfind a satisfactory agreement between models and data. We also confirm that\nnear--IR fluctuations and fluctuation colors are mostly driven by age in the\nMagellanic cluster populations, and that in this respect they constitute a\nsequence in which the Fornax Cluster galaxies fit adequately.

(iii) Rather than on the initial metallicity of a stellar\npopulation, M* depends on the actual [O/H] of the observed PNe, a quantity that\nmay differ significantly from the initial value (due to dredge-up episodes),\nespecially in young and intermediate-age PN populations.

Previous work treated\nlarge disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius exceeds\nthe critical radius (supercritical disks) where the sound speed in the FUV\nheated layer exceeds the escape speed. This paper shows that significant mass\nloss still takes place for subcritical systems. Some of the gas extends beyond\nthe disk edge (above the disk surface) to larger distances where the\ntemperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The\nevaporation rate is a sensitive function of the stellar mass and disk radius,\nwhich determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines\nthe temperature structure of the flow. Disks around red dwarfs are readily\nevaporated and shrink to disk radii of 15 AU on short time scales (10 Myr) when\nexposed to moderate FUV fields with $G_0$ = 3000. Although disks around solar\ntype stars are more durable, these disks shrink to 15 AU in 10 Myr for intense\nFUV radiation fields with $G_0$ = 30,000; such fields exist in the central 0.7\npc of a cluster with N = 4000 stars.

At least half\nof the objects appear to harbor a warm absorber, as found previously in Seyfert\n1 galaxies. We find significant detections of FeKalpha emission lines in at\nleast twelve objects, whilst there is evidence for some broadening of the line\nprofile, compared to the EPIC-pn resolution, in five of these quasars.\n  The determination of the nature of this broadening (e.g., Keplerian motion, a\nblend of lines, relativistic effects) is not possible with the present data and\nrequires either higher S/N or higher resolution spectra. In seven objects the\nline is located between 6.7-7keV, corresponding to highly ionized iron, whereas\nin the other five objects the line energy is consistent with 6.4 keV, i.e.\ncorresponding to near neutral iron. The ionized lines tend to be found in the\nquasars with the steepest X-ray spectra. We also find a correlation between the\ncontinuum power law index and the optical Hbeta width, in both the soft and\nhard X-ray bands, whereby the steepest X-ray spectra are found in objects with\nnarrow Hbeta widths, which confirms previous ROSAT and ASCA results. The soft\nand hard band X-ray photon indices are also strongly correlated, i.e. the\nsteepest soft X-ray spectra correspond the steepest hard X-ray spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2004 13:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The inherently recursive\nstructure of the hypernodal graph model aptly characterizes both the structure\nand dynamic of the 3-sat problem, a broadly applicable, though intractable,\ncomputer science problem. In this paper I first discuss the structure of the\n3-sat problem, analyzing the relation of 3-sat to 2-sat, a related, though\ntractable problem. I then discuss sub-clauses and sub-clause thresholds and the\ntransformation of sub-clauses into implication graphs, demonstrating how\ncombinations of implication graphs are equivalent to hypernodal graphs.

Although\nexperimental data on dependence of Sh on Re for various ice crystals of\ninterest in cloud physics have been previously obtained, extrapolation of the\ndata to smaller particles for Re=0 has been unreliable. We present a simple\ncomputational algorithm for computing Sh at Re=0 for various crystals of\ninterest, which will allow proper coverage over the whole Re range applicable\nto ice crystals. The method we present can be applied to any crystal of\nrectilinear shape. The approach was as follows: the model crystal is positioned\nin a box and an electric field is applied between the crystal and the box,\nsimulating the initial growth stage of ice crystals. Using a finite Cartesian\ngrid system of variable lattice separations, the corners of ice crystal are\nassigned to particular lattice points, thereby defining the geometry of the\ncrystal. A discrete version of Gauss' flux law is developed and used for this\nlattice system. Sh (at Re=0) is obtained for hexagonal plates, hexagonal\ncolumns, broad branched crystals, stellar crystals, and capped columns. Our\ncalculations reveal that our simple computational algorithm provides the values\nof Sh for these shapes to within 5% error from the values obtained through\nestimates in previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2004 06:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}
