On the contrary, other properties of\nLSI+61303 fit a model where the companion is accreting even with two events of\nsuper-critical accretion along the orbit. The very recent discovery of a radio\njet extending ca. 200 AU at both sides of a central core has definitely proved\nthe occurrence of accretion--ejection processes in this system.

Concerning the second ejection, with radio\nbursts, we point out that it can be also traced in the X-ray data, both in\nepisodes of hardening of the X-ray emission and in a transition from soft- to\nhard-states at the onsets of radiobursts. In fact, both hardening and\ntransitions between spectral states are related to the dramatic change in the\nstructure of the accretion disk preceeding the ejection.

A central issue in GRB studies is the process whereby energy\nis released from the GRB engine. One scenario is the collapsar model, where the\nevolved stellar core promptly collapses to a black hole surrounded by a\nmassive, intermittently-accreting torus of nuclear density material. A second\nscenario is the supranova model, where the first step of a two-step collapse\nprocess leaves behind a rapidly rotating neutron star stabilized by rotation,\nwhich later collapses to a black hole while making the GRB. In the supranova\nmodel, a powerful pulsar wind lasting days to weeks after the supernova makes\ndistinctive signatures from the heating of the supernova remnant (SNR) shell,\nwhich should be discovered with Swift. This model also predicts nonstandard\nreddened excesses from the cooling SNR due to the range of delays between the\ntwo collapse events, contrary to observations of SN emissions from low redshift\nGRBs which favor the collapsar model. The observational basis for both models\nis critically reviewed. An outline of a GRB model is proposed where the second\ncollapse takes place within minutes to hours after the primary SN event, during\nwhich time loss of centrifugal support along the rotation axis of the neutron\nstar provides a relatively baryon-clean polar environment along which a newly\nformed, rapidly spinning black hole drives collimated baryon-dilute outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2004 15:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Specifically, we follow the evolution\nof the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature dependence of the transport\ncoefficients shows a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior when\nthe melt is cooled. It is demonstrated that, on intermediate time scales, a\nsmall fraction of oxygen and silicon atoms are more mobile than expected from a\nGaussian approximation. These highly mobile particles form transient clusters\nlarger than that resulting from random statistics, indicating that dynamics are\nspatially heterogeneous. An analysis of the clusters reveals that the mean\ncluster size is maximum at times intermediate between ballistic and diffusive\nmotion, and the maximum size increases with decreasing temperature. In\nparticular, the growth of the clusters continues when the transport\ncoefficients follow an Arrhenius law. These findings imply that the structural\nrelaxation in silica cannot be understood as a statistical bond breaking\nprocess.

The transition from $I$-balls to\n$Q$-balls is made efficient by the $D$-term instability and during this process\nsome fraction of the charge of the $Q$-ball is emitted.

Assuming that the\npotential and current density are almost homogeneous in the direction\ntransversal to the flow we compute the beam current and profile by a\nvariational method. We find that the average current density scales as the\nreciprocal of the beam width when the latter becomes very small. The total\ncylindrical beam current thus decreases proportionly to its diameter while the\ntotal current of a sheet becomes almost independent of the width in this\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2004 17:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 16:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2004 22:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
