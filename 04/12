Ultrafast kinetic studies of 200 nm photon induced electron\ndetachment from Br-, HO- and [SO3]^2- suggest that the prompt yield of\nthermalized electron does not change in these solutions; rather, the ionic\nstrength effect originates in more efficient recombination of geminate pairs.\nWithin the framework of the recently proposed mean force potential (MFP) model\nof charge separation dynamics in such photosystems, the observed changes are\ninterpreted as an increase in the short-range attractive potential between the\ngeminate partners.
