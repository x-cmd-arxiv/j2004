Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network\ncan sustain so that it still contains a large (i.e. linear-sized) connected\ncomponent that still has approximately the same expansion as the original\nfault-free network. For this we apply a pruning technique which culls away\nparts of the faulty network which have poor expansion. This technique can be\napplied to both adversarial faults and to random faults. For adversarial faults\nwe prove that for every network with expansion alpha, a large connected\ncomponent with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for\nup to a constant times alpha n faults. This result is tight in the sense that\nevery graph G of size n and uniform expansion alpha(.), i.e. G has an expansion\nof alpha(n) and every subgraph G' of size m of G has an expansion of\nO(alpha(m)), can be broken into sublinear components with omega(alpha(n) n)\nfaults.\n  For random faults we observe that the situation is significantly different,\nbecause in this case the expansion of a graph only gives a very weak bound on\nits resilience to random faults. More specifically, there are networks of\nuniform expansion O(sqrt{n}) that are resilient against a constant fault\nprobability but there are also networks of uniform expansion Omega(1/log n)\nthat are not resilient against a O(1/log n) fault probability. Thus, a\ndifferent parameter is needed. For this we introduce the span of a graph which\nallows us to determine the maximum fault probability in a much better way than\nthe expansion can.

Until now, however, these\nmodes are only found for hard core systems. Here we report new results on\nLyapunov spectra and Lyapunov vectors (LVs) for Lennard-Jones fluids. By\nconsidering the Fourier transform of the coordinate fluctuation density\n$u^{(\\alpha)}(x,t)$, it is found that the LVs with $\\lambda \\approx 0$ are\nhighly dominated by a few components with low wave-numbers.\n  These numerical results provide strong evidence that hydrodynamic Lyapunov\nmodes do exist in soft-potential systems, although the collective Lyapunov\nmodes are more vague than in hard-core systems. In studying the density and\ntemperature dependence of these modes, it is found that, when the value of\nLyapunov exponent $\\lambda^{(\\alpha)}$ is plotted as function of the dominant\nwave number $k_{max}$ of the corresponding LV, all data from simulations with\ndifferent densities and temperatures collapse onto a single curve. This shows\nthat the dispersion relation $\\lambda^{(\\alpha)}$ vs. $k_{max}$ for\nhydrodynamical Lyapunov modes appears to be universal irrespective of the\nparticle density and temperature of the system.\n  Despite the wave-like character of the LVs, no step-like structure exists in\nthe Lyapunov spectrum of the systems studied here, in contrast to the hard-core\ncase. Further numerical simulations show that the finite-time LEs fluctuate\nstrongly. We have also investigated localization features of LVs and propose a\nnew length scale to characterize the Hamiltonian spatio-temporal chaotic\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2004 15:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-12-07"}

If two parties\nshare a classical random string, one of them can transmit a quantum state to\nthe other so that an eavesdropper gets little or no information about the state\nbeing transmitted. Perfect encryption schemes leak no information at all about\nthe message. Approximate encryption schemes leak a non-zero (though small)\namount of information but require a shorter shared random key. Approximate\nschemes with short keys have been shown to have a number of applications in\nquantum cryptography and information theory.\n  This paper provides the first deterministic, polynomial-time constructions of\nquantum approximate encryption schemes with short keys. Previous constructions\n(quant-ph/0307104) are probabilistic--that is, they show that if the operators\nused for encryption are chosen at random, then with high probability the\nresulting protocol will be a secure encryption scheme. Moreover, the resulting\nprotocol descriptions are exponentially long. Our protocols use keys of the\nsame length as (or better length than) the probabilistic constructions; to\nencrypt $n$ qubits approximately, one needs $n+o(n)$ bits of shared key.\n  An additional contribution of this paper is a connection between classical\ncombinatorial derandomization and constructions of pseudo-random matrix\nfamilies in a continuous space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2004 17:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
