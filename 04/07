The absorption features were\nseparated into multiple components and separated into stellar and interstellar\nparts based on kinematics. We find that three of the dwarfs show outflows, with\nan average blueshift of 27 km/s. This is small compared to the highest velocity\ncomponents in NGC 1614 and M82 (blueshifted by 150 km/s and 91 km/s,\nrespectively); these two brighter galaxies also show more complex absorption\nprofiles than the dwarfs. None of the outflow speeds clearly exceed the escape\nvelocity of the host galaxy. Sightlines in NGC 2363 and NGC4214 apparently\nintersect expanding shells. We compare the shocked gas velocity (v_NaD) to the\nionized gas velocity (v_Halpha) and interpret the velocity difference as either\na trapped ionization front (NGC 4214) or a leaky HII region (NGC 2363).

This paper is\nan extension of our previous paper (Mizuno et al. 2004). The current\ncalculation focuses on the effect of black hole rotation using general\nrelativistic MHD with simplified microphysics. Initially, we assume that the\ncore collapse is failed in this star. A few solar mass rotating black hole is\ninserted by hand into the calculation. We consider two cases, the co-rotating\ncase and counter-rotating case with respect to the black hole rotation.\nAlthough the counter-rotating case may be unrealistic for collapsar, we perform\nas a maximally dragging case of magnetic field. The simulation results show the\nformation of a disk-like structure and the generation of a jet-like outflow\nnear the central black hole. The jet-like outflow propagates outwardly with the\ntwisted magnetic field and becomes collimated. We have found that the jets are\ngenerated and accelerated mainly by the magnetic field. The total jet velocity\nin the rotating black hole case is comparable to that of the non-rotating black\nhole case (Mizuno et al. 2004), 0.3c. When the rotation of the black hole is\nfaster, the magnetic field is twisted strongly owing to the frame-dragging\neffect. The magnetic energy stored by the twisting magnetic field is converted\nto kinetic energy of the jet directly rather than propagating as an Alfven\nwave. Thus, as the rotation of the black hole becomes faster, the poloidal\nvelocity of the jet becomes faster. In the rapidly rotating black hole case the\njet-like outflow can be produced by the frame dragging effect only through the\ntwisting of magnetic field even if there is no stellar rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2004 06:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The Milky Way thick disk, the only one\nstudied in detail, contains mostly old disk stars (~10 Gyr), so that thick\ndisks are likely to trace the early stages of disk evolution. Previous\ndetections of thick disk stellar light in external galaxies have been\noriginally made for early-type, edge-on galaxies but detailed 2D thick/thin\ndisk decompositions have been reported for only a scant handful of mostly\nlate-type disk galaxies. We present in this paper for the first time explicit\n3D thick/thin disk decompositions characterising the presence and properties\n(eg scalelength and scaleheight) for a sample of eight lenticular galaxies by\nfitting 3D disk models to the data. For six out of the eight galaxies we were\nable to derive a consistent thin/thick disk model. The mean scaleheight of the\nthick disk is 3.6 times larger than that of the thin disk. The scalelength of\nthe thick disk is about twice, and its central luminosity density between 3-10%\nof, the thin disk value. Both thin and thick disk are truncated at similar\nradii. This implies that thick disks extend over fewer scalelengths than thin\ndisks, and turning a thin disk into a thick one requires therefore vertical but\nlittle radial heating. All these structural parameters are similar to thick\ndisk parameters for later Hubble-type galaxies previously studied. We discuss\nour data in respect to present models for the origin of thick disks, either as\npre- or post-thin-disk structures, providing new observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2004 13:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Herein is presented a true\n``historical'' scenario of events, that led to my being the first person\n(Williams 1991) to successfully work out the Penrose mechanism in\nfour-dimensions (three-space momenta and energy). Before working out a solution\nto the Penrose mechanism: to extract energy from a rotating black hole, the\nPenrose mechanism (since first proposed by Roger Penrose in 1969) had been\nattempted by scientists over the world for nearly two decades, with little\nsuccess, although making some progress. In the Penrose analysis of Williams\n(1991, 1995) details of the behavior of efficient Penrose relativistic\nscattering processes in the ergosphere are described. The reason a solution\neluded other scientists before me is that there was very little known about\norbits inside the ergosphere, where space and time are no longer separable, as\nmeasured by an observer at infinity (i.e., far away from the Kerr black hole).\nIn this Letter, I describe how analytic derivations of the conserved energy and\nazimuthal angular momentum of particle orbits not confined to the equatorial\nplane allowed me to succeed where others, whose ``shoulders'' I stood on, had\nfailed.
