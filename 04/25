A special\nemphasis is placed on establishing the correspondence between classical and\nquantum theories, for which purpose transformation properties of the\n\\hbar^0-order radiative contributions to the effective gravitational field\nunder deformations of a reference frame are determined. Using the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism it is shown that the one-loop contributions\nviolate the principle of general covariance, in the sense that the quantities\nwhich are classically invariant under such deformations take generally\ndifferent values in different reference frames. In particular, variation of the\nscalar curvature under transitions between different reference frames is\ncalculated explicitly. Furthermore, the long-range properties of the two-point\ncorrelation function of the gravitational field are examined. Using the\nSchwinger-Keldysh formalism it is proved that this function is finite in the\ncoincidence limit outside the region of particle localization. In this limit,\nthe leading term in the long-range expansion of the correlation function is\ncalculated explicitly, and the relative value of the root mean square\nfluctuation of the Newton potential is found to be 1/\\sqrt{2}. It shown also\nthat in the case of a macroscopic gravitating body, the terms violating general\ncovariance, and the field fluctuation are both suppressed by a factor 1/N,\nwhere N is the number of particles in the body. This leads naturally to a\nmacroscopic formulation of the correspondence between classical and quantum\ntheories of gravitation. As an application of the obtained results, the secular\nprecession of a test particle orbit in the field of a black hole is determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2004 08:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The input includes an effective two-nucleon force for the alpha alpha\nresonating-group method and a new effective Lambda N force for the Lambda alpha\ninteraction. The latter force is a simple two-range Gaussian potential for each\nspin-singlet and triplet state, generated from the phase-shift behavior of the\nquark-model hyperon-nucleon interaction, fss2, by using an inversion method\nbased on supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Owing to the exact treatment of the\nPauli-forbidden states between the clusters, the present three-cluster Faddeev\nformalism can describe the mutually related, alpha alpha, 3 alpha and alpha\nalpha Lambda systems, in terms of a unique set of the baryon-baryon\ninteractions. For the three-range Minnesota force which describes the alpha\nalpha phase shifts quite accurately, the ground-state and excitation energies\nof 9Be Lambda are reproduced within 100 - 200 keV accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 2004 08:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2004 12:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
