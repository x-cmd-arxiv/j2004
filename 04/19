In particular, we explore the degree to which the radial positions of\ngalaxy clusters can be determined tomographically, by using photometric\nredshifts of background source galaxies. We quantify the errors in the\ntomographic redshifts, and study their dependence on mass, redshift, detection\nsignificance, and filtering scheme. A Tomographic Matched Filtering (TMF)\nscheme, which combines tomography and matched filtering, is introduced, which\noptimally detects clusters of galaxies in weak lensing surveys. The TMF\nexploits the extra information provided by photometric redshifts of background\nsource galaxies, neglected in previous studies, to optimally weight the\nsources. The efficacy and reliability of the TMF is investigated using a large\nensemble of mock observations from our simulations and detailed comparisons are\nmade to other filters. Using photometric redshift information with the TMF\nenhances the number of clusters detected with S/N > 4.5 by as much as 76%, and\nit increases the dynamic range of weak lensing searches for clusters, detecting\nmore high redshift clusters and extending the mass sensitivity down to the\nscale of large groups. Furthermore, we find that coarsely binning source\ngalaxies in as few as three redshift bins is sufficient to realize the gains of\nthe TMF. Thus, the tomographic filtering techniques presented here can be\napplied to current ground based weak lensing data in as few as three bands.\nCosmological applications of mass selected cluster samples are also discussed.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2004 07:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2005 16:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
