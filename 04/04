We find that for reasonable choices\nof parameters, photons in the range of 10's to 100's of GeV may be emitted in\nthe prompt phase. Photons above this range are subject to electron-positron\npair production with fireball photons and would be absent from the spectrum\nescaping the gamma-ray burst. We find that, in such cases, the fireball becomes\noptically thin again at ultra-high energies ($\\gtrsim$ PeV). On the other hand,\nfor sufficiently large fireball bulk Lorentz factors, the fireball is optically\nthin at all energies. Both for $\\gamma\\gamma$ self-absorbed and optically thin\ncases, the escaping high energy photons can interact with infra-red and\nmicrowave background photons to produce delayed secondary photons in the\nGeV-TeV range. These may be observable with GLAST, or at low redshifts with\nground-based air Cherenkov telescopes.

Though in the minimal version of the SM, and without considering the\ninteraction of the SM particles with additional degrees of freedom, this\nscenario has been ruled out given the current bounds for the Higgs mass, this\nstill remains an open possibility in supersymmetric extensions of the SM. In\nrecent years it has also been realized that large scale magnetic fields could\nbe of primordial origin. A natural question is what effect, if any, these\nfields could have played during the electroweak phase transition in connection\nto the generation of baryon number. Prior to the electroweak symmetry breaking,\nthe magnetic modes able to propagate for large distances belonged to the U(1)\ngroup of hypercharge and hence receive the name of hypermagnetic fields. In\nthis contribution, we summarize recent work aimed to explore the effects that\nthese fields could have introduced during a first order electroweak phase\ntransition. In particular, we show how these fields induce a CP asymmetric\nscattering of fermions off the true vacuum bubbles nucleated during the phase\ntransition.
