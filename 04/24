These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently\nselected by the simple observed color criterion J-K>2.3. In this paper we\npresent NIR spectroscopy with Keck/NIRSPEC of six DRGs at 2.4<z<3.2. We detect\ncontinuum emission and emission lines of all observed galaxies. Equivalent\nwidths of H alpha are 20-30 Ang, smaller than measured for LBGs and nearby\nLIRGs, and comparable to normal nearby galaxies. The modest equivalent widths\nimply that the galaxies either have a decreasing star formation rate, or that\nthey are very dusty. Fitting both the photometry and the H alpha lines, we find\ncontinuum extinction A_V=1-2 mag, ages 1-2.5 Gyr, star formation rates 200-400\nsolar masses/yr, and stellar masses 1-5x10^11 solar masses for models with\nconstant star formation rates. From [NII]/H alpha ratios we infer that the\nmetallicities are high, 1-1.5 x Solar. For four galaxies we can determine line\nwidths from the optical emission lines. The widths are high, ranging from\n130-240 km/s, and by combining data for LBGs and DRGs we find significant\ncorrelations between linewidth and restframe U-V color, and between linewidth\nand stellar mass. The latter correlation has a similar slope and offset as the\n``baryonic Tully-Fisher relation'' for nearby galaxies. The median dynamical\nmass is ~2x10^11 solar masses, supporting the high stellar masses inferred from\nthe photometry. We find that the median M/L_V ~ 0.8, a factor of ~5 higher than\nmeasured for LBGs. We infer from our small sample that DRGs are dustier, more\nmetal rich, more massive, and have higher ages than z=3 LBGs of the same\nrest-frame V-band luminosity. Their high M/L ratios imply that they contribute\nsignificantly to the stellar mass density at z~2.5.

The novel\nparametrization renders the relation between bi-spectrum and three-point\ncorrelation function especially transparent as a set of two-dimensional Hankel\ntransforms. It is expected on theoretical grounds, that three-point statistics\ncan be described accurately with only a few multipoles. In particular, we show\nthat in the weakly non-linear regime, the multipoles of the reduced bispectrum,\n$Q_l$, are significant only up to quadrupole. Moreover, the non-linear bias in\nthe weakly non-linear regime only affects the monopole order of these\nstatistics. As a consequence, a simple, novel set of estimators can be\nconstructed to constrain galaxy bias. In addition, the quadrupole to dipole\nratio is independent of the bias, thus it becomes a novel diagnostic of the\nunderlying theoretical assumptions: weakly non-linear gravity and perturbative\nlocal bias. To illustrate the use of our approach, we present predictions based\non both power law, and CDM models.

The problem of determining the mixing time of the cyclic-to-random\nshuffle was raised by Aldous and Diaconis in 1986. Recently, Mironov used this\nshuffle as a model for the cryptographic system known as ``RC4'' and proved an\nupper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time. We prove a matching lower bound,\nthus establishing that the mixing time is indeed of order $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.\nWe also prove an upper bound of O(n log n) for the mixing time of any\n``semi-random transposition shuffle'', i.e., any shuffle in which a random card\nis exchanged with another card chosen according to an arbitrary (deterministic\nor random) rule. To prove our lower bound, we exhibit an explicit\ncomplex-valued test function which typically takes very different values for\npermutations arising from the cyclic-to-random-shuffle and for uniform random\npermutations; we expect that this test function may be useful in future\nanalysis of RC4. Perhaps surprisingly, the proof hinges on the fact that the\nfunction exp(z)-1 has nonzero fixed points in the complex plane. A key insight\nfrom our work is the importance of complex analysis tools for uncovering\nstructure in nonreversible Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2004 18:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The reliability of such networks could be judged by the probability\nthat a connection between genes is spurious, resulting from chance fluctuations\nrather than from a true biological relationship. Results: Unlike the false\ndiscovery rate and positive false discovery rate, the decisive false discovery\nrate (dFDR) is exactly equal to a conditional probability without assuming\nindependence or the randomness of hypothesis truth values. This property is\nuseful not only in the common application to the detection of differential gene\nexpression, but also in determining the probability of a spurious connection in\na reconstructed gene network.
