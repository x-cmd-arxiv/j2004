WMAP has sufficiently broad frequency coverage\nto constrain SZ without the addition of higher frequency data: the SZ power\nspectrum amplitude is expected to increase 50% from W to Q frequency band.\nThis, in combination with the low noise in WMAP, allows us to strongly\nconstrain the SZ contribution. We derive an optimal frequency combination of\nWMAP cross-spectra to extract SZ in the presence of noise, CMB, and radio point\nsources, which are marginalized over. We find that the SZ contribution is less\nthan 2% (95% c.l.) at the first acoustic peak in W band. Under the assumption\nthat the removed radio point sources are not correlated with SZ this limit\nimplies sigma_8<1.07 at 95% c.l. We investigate the effect on the cosmological\nparameters of allowing an SZ component. We run Monte Carlo Markov Chains with\nand without an SZ component and find that the addition of SZ does not affect\nany of the cosmological conclusions. We conclude that SZ does not contaminate\nthe WMAP CMB or change cosmological parameters, refuting the recent claims that\nthey may be corrupted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2004 19:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Due to solar\nperturbations, the argument of pericenter of a satellite usually precesses from\n0 to 360 degrees. However, at inclinations higher than 39.3 degrees and lower\nthan 140.7 degrees a new kind of behavior occurs for which the argument of\npericenter oscillates around +/-90 degrees. In this work we will concentrate on\nthe orbital history of the saturnian satellite S/2000 S5 Kiviuq, one of the\nsatellites currently known to be in such resonance Kiviuq's orbit is very close\nto the separatrix of the Kozai resonance. Due to perturbations from the other\njovian planets, it is expected that orbits near the Kozai separatrix may show\nsignificant chaotic behavior. This is important because chaotic diffusion may\ntransfer orbits from libration to circulation, and vice versa. To identify\nchaotic orbits we used two well-known methods: the Frequency Analysis Method\n(Laskar 1990) and Maximum Lyapunov Exponents (Benettin et al. 1980). Our\nresults show that the Kozai resonance is crossed by a web of secondary\nresonances, whose arguments involve combinations of the argument of pericenter,\nthe argument of the Great Inequality, longitude of the node, and other terms\nrelated to the secular frequencies g5, g6, and s6. Many test orbits whose\nprecession period is close to the period of the Great Inequality (883 yrs), or\nsome of its harmonics, are trapped by these secondary resonances, and show\nsignificant chaotic behavior. Planetary migration, by moving the locations of\nthese secondary resonances, may have depleted an original population of Kozai\nresonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2004 17:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Additional\ndiagnostics are needed to further constrain the UIB carrier, such as probing\nexcitation sources which range from UV-strong to UV-weak, in order to determine\nthe ``band gap'' of the UIB carrier. Observations and models suggest that the\nUIBs can be found in sources with weak UV fields.
