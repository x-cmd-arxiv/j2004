These distortions are connected with the simple fact, that the\nsuperposition of blackbodies with different temperatures in general is not a\nblackbody. We show, that in the limit of small temperature fluctuations, the\nsuperposition of blackbodies leads to a y-type spectral distortion. It is\nknown, that the CMB dipole induces a y-type spectral distortion with quadrupole\nand monopole angular distribution leading to a corresponding whole sky\ny-parameter of y~2.6\\cdot 10^{-7}.We show here that taking the difference of\nthe CMB signal in the direction of the maximum and minimum of the CMB dipole\ndue to the superposition of two blackbodies leads to a spectral distortion with\ny~3.1\\cdot 10^{-6}. The amplitude of this distortion can be calculated to the\nsame precision as the CMB dipole, i.e. 0.3% today. Therefore it may be used as\na source with brightness of several or tens of \\muK to cross calibrate and\ncalibrate different frequency channels of CMB surveys with precision of a few\ntens or hundreds of nK. Furthermore, we show in this work that primordial\nanisotropies for multipoles 2\\leq l \\leq 1000 also lead to spectral distortions\nbut with much smaller y-parameter, i.e. y\\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-9}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2004 01:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The $U$-duality\nand toroidal membrane world-volume modular groups appear as a Howe dual pair in\na larger, exceptional, group. A detailed analysis is carried out for $M$-theory\ncompactified on a 3-torus, where the target-space $Sl(3,\\Zint)\\times\nSl(2,\\Zint)$ $U$-duality and $Sl(3,\\Zint)$ world-volume modular groups are\nembedded in $E_{6(6)}(\\Zint)$. Unlike previous semi-classical expansions,\n$U$-duality is built in manifestly and realized at the quantum level thanks to\nFourier invariance of cubic characters. In addition to winding modes, a pair of\nnew discrete, flux-like, quantum numbers are necessary to ensure invariance\nunder the larger group. The action for these modes is of Born-Infeld type,\ninterpolating between standard Polyakov and Nambu-Goto membrane actions.

This differs\nfrom the classical matrix-tree theorem in that only small pieces of the matrix\n(n-dimensional minors) are needed to compute small (n-dimensional) marginals.\nCalculation of the matrix entries relies on the calculation of the Green's\nfunction for G, which is not a local calculation.

DNA is a\nquasicrystal possessing maximum packing efficiency in a hierarchy of spirals or\nloops.

They allow living\ncells to control a large number of biological processes, such as gene\nexpression and cell signalling. In biochemical networks, the concentrations of\nthe components are often low. This means that the discrete nature of the\nreactants and the stochastic character of their interactions have to be taken\ninto account. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the components can be of\ncrucial importance. However, the current numerical techniques for simulating\nbiochemical networks either ignore the particulate nature of matter or treat\nthe spatial fluctuations in a mean-field manner. We have developed a new\ntechnique, called Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD), that makes it\npossible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in both\ntime and space. In this scheme, a maximum time step is chosen such that only\nsingle particles or pairs of particles have to be considered. For these\nparticles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green's\nfunctions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the\nSmoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm. This allows GFRD to\nmake large jumps in time when the particles are far apart from each other.\nHere, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression. The\nsimulations reveal that the scheme is highly efficient. Under biologically\nrelevant conditions, GFRD is up to six orders of magnitude faster than\nconventional particle-based techniques for simulating biochemical networks in\ntime and space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 16:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2004 10:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recent experimental evidences point out that clustering of proteins has\na vital role in many cellular processes. Upsurge in fluorescence imaging\nmethods has given a new spin to our ability to probe protein interactions in\ncellular and sub-cellular compartments. Despite the increasing detection\nsensitivity, quantitative information that can be obtained from these imaging\nmethods is limited. This is primarily due to (i) the difficulty in tracking the\nproblem analytically and (ii) limitations in spatio-temporal resolution that\ncan be achieved in interrogating living cells in real time. A novel point of\nview based on diffusion-driven percolative clustering is proposed here that can\nplausibly shed more light on the complex issues of protein-protein\ninteractions. Since this model is open to computational analysis, it is\nquantitative in its premise. Besides being able to analyze the phenomenon, the\npower of any model is gauged by its ability to predict interesting and novel\nfeatures of the phenomenon itself, which can subsequently be tested by\nadditional experiments. To this end, an experimental assay based on\nfluorescence lifetime imaging is proposed to verify the validity of the\npercolation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 17:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We develop a formalism,\napplicable in both the weak and strong probe regimes, to analyze such\nexperiments and establish several new results. Investigating examples relevant\nto Rb-87 experimental parameters we see a variety of novel two-component BEC\ndynamics occur during the storage, including interference fringes, gentle\nbreathing excitations, and two-component solitons. We find the dynamics when\nthe levels |F=1, M_F=-1> and |F=2, M_F=+1> are well suited to designing\ncontrolled processing of the information. By switching the coupling field back\non, the processed information is rewritten onto probe pulses which then\npropagate out as slow light pulses. We calculate the fidelity of information\ntransfer between the atomic and light fields upon the switch-on and subsequent\noutput. The fidelity is affected both by absorption of small length scale\nfeatures and absorption of regions of the pulse stored near the condensate\nedge. In the strong probe case, we find that when the oscillator strengths for\nthe two transitions are equal the fidelity is not strongly sensitive to the\nprobe strength, while when they are unequal the fidelity is worse for stronger\nprobes. Applications to distant communication between BECs, squeezed light\ngeneration and quantum information are anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2004 20:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
