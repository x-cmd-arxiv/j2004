Overall, mass accretion rates appear lower than those measured\nby other authors in the Orion flanking fields or in Taurus-Auriga. Mass\naccretion rates remain low even in the vicinity of the birth line of Palla &\nStahler, suggesting that in the core of the Trapezium cluster disk accretion\nhas been recently depressed by an external mechanism. We suggest that the UV\nradiation generated by the Trapezium OB stars, responsible for the disk\nevaporation, may also cause the drop of the mass accretion rate. In this\nscenario, low-mass stars may terminate their pre-main sequence evolution with\nmasses lower than those they would have reached if disk accretion could have\nproceeded undisturbed until the final disk consumption. In OB associations the\nlow-mass end of the Initial Mass Function may therefore be affected by the\nrapid evolution of the most massive cluster's stars, causing a surplus\n\"accretion aborted\" very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and a deficit of\nintermediate mass stars.
