The spectra are based on non-LTE line\nblanketed atmosphere models with stellar winds calculated using the CMFGEN code\nof Hillier & Miller (1998). We draw the following conclusions. First, we find\nthat the total number of Lyman photons emitted is almost independent of line\nblanketing effects and metallicity for a given effective temperature. This is\nbecause the flux that is blocked by the forest of metal lines at wavelengths\nshorter than 600 Angstrom is redistributed mainly within the Lyman continuum.\nSecond, the spectral type, as defined by the ratio of the equivalent widths of\nHeI 4471 Angstrom and HeII 4542 Angstrom, is shown to depend noticeably on the\nmicroturbulent velocity in the atmosphere, on metallicity and, within the\nluminosity class of dwarfs, on gravity. Third, we confirm the decrease in the\neffective temperature for a given spectral type due to the inclusion of line\nblanketing recently found by e.g. Martins et al. (2002). Finally, we find that\nthe SED below ~450 Angstrom is highly dependent on metallicity.

We show that\nsuch relevant double-trace perturbation introduces changes in the coefficients\nin the boundary terms of the action, which in turn govern the existence of a\nbound state in the bulk. For instance, we show that the usual action,\ncontaining no additional boundary terms, gives rise to a bound state, which can\nbe avoided only through the addition of a proper boundary term. Another\nnotorious example is that of a conformally coupled scalar field, supplemented\nby a Gibbons-Hawking term, for which there is no associated bound state. In\ngeneral, in both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases, we explicitly\ncompute the boundary terms which give rise to a bound state, and which ones do\nnot.

We study the representations of finite groups G of automorphisms\nof X induced on the base extension of this vector space to k, and obtain two\nmain results:\n  First, the sum of the nonprojective direct summands of the representation,\ni.e. its core, is determined explicitly by local data given by the fixed point\nstructure of the group acting on the curve. As a corollary, we derive a\ncongruence formula for the p-rank.\n  Secondly, the multiplicities of the projective direct summands of quotient\ncurves, i.e. their Borne invariants, are calculated in terms of the Borne\ninvariants of the original curve and ramification data. In particular, this is\na generalization of both Nakajima's equivariant Deuring-Shafarevich formula and\na previous result of Borne in the case of free actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2004 20:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2004 23:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
