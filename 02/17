We show\nthat the variation of the Kogelnik efficiency versus Bragg angle depends only\non one parameter, given by $P_{tune} = (\\Delta n d)/(n \\Lambda)$, where:\n$\\Delta n$ is semi-amplitude of the refractive index modulation; $n$ is the\naverage index; $d$ is the thickness of the active layer; and $\\Lambda$ is the\ngrating period. The efficiency has a well defined dependence on polarization.\nIn particular, it is possible to obtain theoretical 100% diffraction efficiency\nwith one linear polarization at any angle or to obtain 100% efficiency with\nunpolarized light at specific angles. In the latter case, high efficiency is\nthe result of aligning the peaks of the s- and p-polarization\nefficiency-versus-thickness curves.
