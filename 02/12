Our observations in the R-band cover the temporal\nrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. We also present the\nresults of multicolor imaging extending to the K-band on three epochs. The\nlightcurve of the R-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar to\nthe lightcurve for long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), i.e., a broken\npower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (F_nu propto t^alpha).\nFurthermore, the spectral energy distribution (SED) has a power-law (F_nu\npropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. However, the decay slope at t<1 day\nis shallow, consistent with zero. This is in qualitative agreement with the\nprediction that XRFs are off-axis classical GRBs. After the first week there is\na strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. The SED after\nthe peak becomes significantly redder. We discuss the possible interpretations\nof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likely\nexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of the\nSED.

The edge energy decreases to 0.87 keV\nduring deep dipping intervals. The detected feature may result from edges of\nmoderately ionized Ne and/or Fe with the average ionization level decreasing\nfrom persistent emission to deep dipping.

In the blatant distinction from regular networks of the \"small\nworld\" (SW) topology [1], regular fractal networks manifests the logarithmic\ndependence of the characteristic path length on number of vertices N which is\ntypically just for random networks. Due to this fact, for the hierarchic\nnetworks there is no effect of an abrupt drop of the mean path length caused by\nthe introduction into a regular structure only a few random edges. The\nclustering coefficient of the hierarchic structures is equal zero and in a\nprocess of randomization it slightly grows up to the random networks value k/N,\nwhere k is mean number of the nearest neighbors, in vivid contrast with the\nsmall world networks behavior. We considered also the problem of unification of\ntwo isolated SW and Caley tree networks in the limits of weak (through one\npoint) and strong (many points) connection and deduced a specific algebra for\nthe mean path length of the unified network in terms of the isolated networks\npath lengths.

This problem leads to elegant\ngeneralisations of well-known combinatorial numbers, specifically Bell and\nStirling numbers. We explicitly give the generating functions for some classes\nof these numbers. In this note we concentrate on the combinatorial graph\napproach, showing how some important classical results of graph theory lead to\ntransparent representations of the combinatorial numbers associated with the\nboson normal ordering problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2004 11:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The selectivity which can be\nachieved in the presence of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is\nlimited by the decoherence rate of the dark state. We present exact analytical\nexpressions for this effect, and also physical models and approximate\nexpressions which give useful insights into the phenomena. When the laser\nfrequencies are near-resonant with the single-photon atomic transitions, EIT is\nessential for achieving discrimination. When the laser frequencies are far\ndetuned, the `bright' two-photon Raman resonance is important for achieving\nselective excitation, while the `dark' resonance (EIT) need not be. The\napplication to laser cooling of a trapped atom is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2004 11:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
