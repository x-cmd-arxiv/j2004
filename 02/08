The\nmagnetic fields in the Galactic halo, mainly revealed by the sky distribution\nof rotation measures of extragalactic radio sources, probably have a global\nstructure of a twisted dipole field. The large-scale field structure in the\nGalactic disk has been most efficiently deduced from pulsar rotation measures\n(RMs). There has been a lot of progress since the 1980s when the magnetic field\nin the local area of our Galaxy was first traced by a very small sample of\nlocal pulsars. Now we have pulsars distributed in about one third of the whole\nGalactic disk of the interstellar medium, which shows that the large-scale\nmagnetic fields go along the spiral arms and that the field directions reverse\nfrom arm to arm. The RMs of newly discovered pulsars in the very inner Galaxy\nhave been used to show the coherent magnetic field in the Norma arm. The\nmagnetic fields in the Galactic disk most probably have a bisymmetric spiral\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2004 12:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
