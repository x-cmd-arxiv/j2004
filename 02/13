We\nreconstruct the KSZ signal by interpolating the CMB fluctuations without making\nany hypothesis besides the CMB fluctuations are Gaussian distributed. We\npresent two ways of estimating the KSZ fluctuations, after the interpolation\nstep.

In a twisting subcase, where our main interests lie, it can be\ngiven the following strange interpretation. If we allow the real Minkowski\nspace to be complexified so that the real Minkowski coordinates x^a take\ncomplex values, i.e., x^a => z^a=x^a+iy^a with complex metric g=eta_abdz^adz^b,\nthe real vacuum Maxwell equations can be extended into the complex and\nrewritten as curlW =iWdot, divW with W =E+iB.

When\nviewed as real fields on the real Minkowski space, z^a=x^a, they possess a real\nprinciple null vector that is shear-free but twisting and diverging. The twist\nis a measure of how far the complex world-line is from the real 'slice'.

Indeed, it is now possible to\ndiagonalize matrices in determinantal spaces of dimensionality up to 10^9 using\nthe Lanczos tridiagonal construction, whose formal and numerical aspects we\nwill analyze. Besides, many new approximation methods have been developed in\norder to overcome the dimensionality limitations. Furthermore, new effective\nnucleon-nucleon interactions have been constructed that contain both two and\nthree-body contributions. The former are derived from realistic potentials\n(i.e., consistent with two nucleon data). The latter incorporate the pure\nmonopole terms necessary to correct the bad saturation and shell-formation\nproperties of the realistic two-body forces. This combination appears to solve\na number of hitherto puzzling problems. In the present review we will\nconcentrate on those results which illustrate the global features of the\napproach: the universality of the effective interaction and the capacity of the\nShell Model to describe simultaneously all the manifestations of the nuclear\ndynamics either of single particle or collective nature. We will also treat in\nsome detail the problems associated with rotational motion, the origin of\nquenching of the Gamow Teller transitions, the double beta-decays, the effect\nof isospin non conserving nuclear forces, and the specificities of the very\nneutron rich nuclei. Many other calculations--that appear to have ``merely''\nspectroscopic interest--are touched upon briefly, although we are fully aware\nthat much of the credibility of the Shell Model rests on them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2004 14:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
