A specific example is the determination of\nstellar astrophysical parameters (APs) - effective temperature, metallicity\netc. - across a wide range of stellar types. I present a novel approach to this\nproblem which makes minimal assumptions about the required filter system. By\nconsidering a filter system as a set of free parameters it may be designed by\noptimizing some figure-of-merit (FoM) with respect to these parameters. In the\nexample considered, the FoM is a measure of how well the filter system can\n`separate' stars with different APs. This separation is vectorial in nature, in\nthe sense that the local directions of AP variance are preferably mutually\northogonal to avoid AP degeneracy. The optimization is carried out with an\nevolutionary algorithm, which uses principles of evolutionary biology to search\nthe parameter space. This model, HFD (Heuristic Filter Design), is applied to\nthe design of photometric systems for the Gaia space astrometry mission. The\noptimized systems show a number of interesting features, not least the\npersistence of broad, overlapping filters. These HFD systems perform as least\nas well as other proposed systems for Gaia, although inadequacies remain in\nall. The principles underlying HFD are quite generic and may be applied to\nfilter design for numerous other projects, such as the search for specific\ntypes of objects or photometric redshift determination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2004 14:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In order to quantify the\ncomparison of our synthetic maps to the observations, we calculate the physical\nscale-autocorrelation length relation (L-L_{cr} relation) both on the synthetic\nHI maps and the HI map of Ho II. The L-L_{cr} relation shows a linear increase\nof the autocorrelation length with the physical scale up to the scale of energy\ninjection and flattens for larger scales.

The slope\nof the L-L_{cr} relation in the linear regime in Ho II is better reproduced by\nmodels where turbulence is coupled with a weak efficiency cooling of the gas.\nThese results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between turbulence\nand the thermodynamics of the gas for structure formation in the ISM.

We have\ndetermined the phase diagram of the diluted model, between the pure model limit\nand the percolation threshold. For the estimation of critical exponents, we\nhave first performed a finite-size scaling study, where we concentrated on\nthree different dilutions. We emphasize in this work the great influence of the\ncross-over phenomena between the pure, disorder and percolation fixed points\nwhich lead to effective critical exponents dependent on the concentration. In a\nsecond set of simulations, the temperature behaviour of physical quantities has\nbeen studied in order to characterize the disorder fixed point more accurately.\nIn particular this allowed us to estimate ratios of some critical amplitudes.\nIn accord with previous observations for other models this provides stronger\nevidence for the existence of the disorder fixed point since the amplitude\nratios are more sensitive to the universality class than the critical\nexponents. Moreover, the question of non-self-averaging at the disorder fixed\npoint is investigated and compared with recent results for the bond-diluted\n$q=4$ Potts model. Overall our numerical results provide evidence that, as\nexpected on theoretical grounds, the critical behaviour of the bond-diluted\nmodel is governed by the same universality class as the site-diluted model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2004 16:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper, we obtain guiding principles which allow the\nconstruction of an extended Hamiltonian formalism for pure space-like axial\ngauge fields. To do so, we clarify the general role residual gauge fields play\nin the space-like axial gauge Schwinger model. In all the calculations we fix\nthe gauge using a rule, $n{\\cdot}A=0$, where $n$ is a space-like constant\nvector and we refer to its direction as $x_-$. Then, to begin with, we\nconstruct a formulation in which the quantization surface is space-like but not\nparallel to the direction of $n$. The quantization surface has a parameter\nwhich allows us to rotate it, but when we do so we keep the direction of the\ngauge field fixed. In that formulation we can use canonical methods. We\nbosonize the model to simplify the investigation. We find that the\nantiderivative, $({\\partial}_-)^{-1}$, is ill-defined whatever quantization\ncoordinates we use as long as the direction of $n$ is space-like.

EPDiff admits a remarkable ansatz for its singular solutions,\ncalled ``diffeons,'' whose momenta are supported on embedded subspaces of the\nambient space. Diffeons are true solitons for some choices of the norm. The\ndiffeon solution ansatz is a momentum map. Consequently. the diffeons evolve\naccording to canonical Hamiltonian equations. We examine diffeon solutions on\nEinstein spaces that are \"mostly\" symmetric, i.e., whose quotient by a subgroup\nof the isometry group is 1-dimensional. An example is the two-sphere, whose\nisometry group $\\SO{3}$ contains $S^1$. In this situation, the singular\ndiffeons (called ``Puckons'') are supported on latitudes (``girdles'') of the\nsphere. For this $S^1$ symmetry of the two-sphere, the canonical Hamiltonian\ndynamics for Puckons reduces from integral partial differential equations to a\ndynamical system of ordinary differential equations for their colatitudes.\nExplicit examples are computed numerically for the motion and interaction of\nthe Puckons on the sphere with respect to the $H^1$ norm. We analyse this case\nand several other 2-dimensional examples.

This hydrophobic gating mechanism is thought to operate in a\nnumber of ion channels, e.g. the nicotinic receptor, bacterial mechanosensitive\nchannels (MscL and MscS) and perhaps in some potassium channels (e.g. KcsA,\nMthK, and KvAP). Simplified pore models allow one to investigate the primary\ncharacteristics of a conduction pathway, namely its geometry (shape, pore\nlength, and radius), the chemical character of the pore wall surface, and its\nlocal flexibility and surface roughness. Our extended (ca. 0.1 \\mu s) molecular\ndynamic simulations show that a short hydrophobic pore is closed to water for\nradii smaller than 0.45 nm. By increasing the polarity of the pore wall (and\nthus reducing its hydrophobicity) the transition radius can be decreased until\nfor hydrophilic pores liquid water is stable down to a radius comparable to a\nwater molecule's radius. Ions behave similarly but the transition from\nconducting to non-conducting pores is even steeper and occurs at a radius of\n0.65 nm for hydrophobic pores. The presence of water vapour in a constriction\nzone indicates a barrier for ion permeation. A thermodynamic model can explain\nthe behaviour of water in nanopores in terms of the surface tensions, which\nleads to a simple measure of \"hydrophobicity\" in this context. Furthermore,\nincreased local flexibility decreases the permeability of polar species. An\nincrease in temperature has the same effect, and we hypothesise that both\neffects can be explained by a decrease in the effective solvent-surface\nattraction which in turn leads to an increase in the solvent-wall surface free\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2004 15:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 16:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
