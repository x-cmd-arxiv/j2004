This effect exists\nbecause of the different spectral energy distributions of galaxies, which are\nin turn quantified by the k-corrections. We demonstrate that this bias occurs\nbecause not all galaxy types are visible in the same absolute magnitude range\nat a given redshift and it mainly arises at high redshift since it is related\nto large k-corrections. We use realistic simulations with observed LFs to\ninvestigate the amplitude of the bias. We also compare our results to the\nglobal LFs derived from Hubble Deep Field-North and -South (HDF) surveys. We\nconclude that, as expected, there is no bias in the global LF measured in the\nabsolute magnitude range where all galaxy types are observable. Beyond this\nrange the faint-end slope of the global LF can be over/under-estimated\ndepending on the adopted LF estimator. The effect is larger when the reference\nfilter in which the global LF is measured, is far from the rest-frame filter in\nwhich galaxies are selected. The fact that LF estimators are differently\naffected by this bias implies that the bias is minimal when the different LF\nestimators give measurements consistent with one another at the faint-end. For\ninstance, we show that the estimators are discrepant in the same way both in\nthe simulated and HDF LFs. This suggests that the HDF LFs are affected by the\npresently studied bias. The best solution to avoid this bias is to derive the\nglobal LF in the reference filter closest to the rest-frame selection filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2004 18:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
