This doubles the number of L dwarfs for which vsini has\nbeen measured. All targets are found to have vsini between 10 and 40 km/s,\nconfirming that L dwarfs are rapid rotators.

First, we find that a hydromagnetic (MHD)\ncoupling between the crust and the core strongly modifies the star's\nprecessional modes when $t_a\\le\\sim (T_s\\times T_p)^{1/2}$; here $t_a$ is the\nAlfven crossing timescale, and $T_s$ and $T_p$ are the star's spin and\nprecession periods, respectively. We argue that in a precessing pulsar PSR\nB1828-11 the restoring MHD stress prevents a free wobble of the crust relative\nto the non-precessing core. Instead, the crust and the proton-electron plasma\nin the core must precess in unison, and their combined ellipticity determines\nthe period of precession. Link has recently shown that the neutron superfluid\nvortices in the core of PSR B1828-11 cannot be pinned to the plasma; he has\nalso argued that this lack of pinning is expected if the proton Fermi liquid in\nthe core is type-I superconductor. In this case, the neutron superfluid is\ndynamically decoupled from the precessing motion. The pulsar's precession\ndecays due to the mutual friction between the neutron superfluid and the plasma\nin the core. The decay is expected to occur over tens to hundreds of precession\nperiods and may be measurable over a human lifetime. Such a measurement would\nprovide information about the strong n-p interaction in the neutron-star core.\nSecond, we consider the effect of gravitomagnetic coupling between the neutron\nsuperfluid in the core and the rest of the star and show that this coupling\nchanges the rate of precession by about 10%.
