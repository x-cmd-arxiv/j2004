The dissipation regions are Unstable Current Sheets\n(UCS), and in their ensemble they form a complex, fractal, evolving network of\nacceleration centers. Acceleration and energy dissipation are thus assumed to\nbe fragmented. A large-scale magnetic topology provides the connectivity\nbetween the UCS and determines in this way the degree of possible multiple\nacceleration. The particles travel along the magnetic field freely without\nloosing or gaining energy, till they reach a UCS. In a UCS, a variety of\nacceleration mechanisms are active, with the end-result that the particles\ndepart with a new momentum. The stochastic acceleration process is represented\nin the form of Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW), which allows to estimate the\nevolution of the energy distribution of the particles.

The\ninhomogeneity in vortex density, which diminishes in the rapid-rotation limit,\nis driven by the discrete way vortices impart angular momentum to the\nsuperfluid. This effect favors highest vortex density in regions where the\nsuperfluid density is most uniform (e.g., the center of a harmonically trapped\ngas). A striking consequence of this is that the boson velocity deviates from a\nrigid-body form exhibiting a radial-shear flow past the vortex lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2004 20:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 19:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The approach to steady state behavior depends on the\nhistory of the packing and the existing force and contact network. We present\nexperiments on shearing of dense granular matter in a 2D Couette geometry in\nwhich we probe the history and evolution of shear bands by measuring particle\ntrajectories and stresses during transients. We find that when shearing is\nstopped and restarted in the same direction, steady state behavior is\nimmediately reached, in agreement with the typical assumption that the system\nis quasistatic. Although some relaxation of the force network is observed when\nshearing is stopped, quasistatic behavior is maintained because the contact\nnetwork remains essentially unchanged. When the direction of shear is reversed,\na transient occurs in which stresses initially decrease, changes in the force\nnetwork reach further into the bulk, and particles far from the wheel become\nmore mobile. This occurs because the force network is fragile to changes\ntransverse to the force network established under previous shear; particles\nmust rearrange before becoming jammed again, thereby providing resistance to\nshear in the reversed direction. The strong force network is reestablished\nafter displacing the shearing surface $\\approx 3d$, where $d$ is the mean grain\ndiameter. Steady state velocity profiles are reached after a shear of $\\leq\n30d$. Particles immediately outside of the shear band move on average less than\n1 diameter before becoming jammed again.

We consider a genome consisting of $ N\n$ genes, so that each gene sequence $ \\sigma $ may be written as $ \\sigma =\n\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 ... \\sigma_N $. We assume a single fitness peak (SFP) model\nfor each gene, so that gene $ i $ has some ``master'' sequence $ \\sigma_{i, 0}\n$ for which it is functioning. The fitness landscape is then determined by\nwhich genes in the genome are functioning, and which are not. The equilibrium\nbehavior of this model may be solved in the limit of infinite sequence length.\nThe central result is that, instead of a single error catastrophe, the model\nexhibits a series of localization to delocalization transitions, which we term\nan ``error cascade.'' As the mutation rate is increased, the selective\nadvantage for maintaining functional copies of certain genes in the network\ndisappears, and the population distribution delocalizes over the corresponding\nsequence spaces. The network goes through a series of such transitions, as more\nand more genes become inactivated, until eventually delocalization occurs over\nthe entire genome space, resulting in a final error catastrophe. This model\nprovides a criterion for determining the conditions under which certain genes\nin a genome will lose functionality due to genetic drift. It also provides\ninsight into the response of gene networks to mutagens. In particular, it\nsuggests an approach for determining the relative importance of various genes\nto the fitness of an organism, in a more accurate manner than the standard\n``deletion set'' method. The results in this paper also have implications for\nmutational robustness and what C.O. Wilke termed ``survival of the flattest.''\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2004 21:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
