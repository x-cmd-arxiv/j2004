The observed SEDs are fitted by combining single stellar\npopulations, with different SFRs and amounts of dust extinction. This approach\ngives us the best flexibility when dealing with the widest variety of physical\nsituation for the target galaxies. In particular we tested the code on three\nclasses of sources: dusty ISO-selected starbursts, K-band selected\nellipticals/S0s and z=2-3 Lyman-break galaxies. We pay particular attention in\nevaluating the uncertainties in the stellar mass estimate, due to degeneracies\nin the physical parameters, different SFHs or metallicities. Based on\noptical-NIR photometric data, the stellar masses are found to have overall\nuncertainties of a factor of ~2 for E/S0s, ~2-5 for the starbursts population,\nand up to 10 for Ly-break galaxies. In any case the latter appear to correspond\nto a galaxy population significantly less massive than those observed at lower\nredshifts, possibly indicating substantial stellar build-up at z~1-2 in the\nfield galaxy population. Using simulated deep SIRTF/IRAC observations of\nstarbursts and Lyman-break galaxies, we investigate how an extension of the\nwavelength dynamic range will decrease the uncertainties in the stellar mass\nestimate, and find that they will reduce for both classes to factors of 2-3,\ngood enough for statistically reliable determinations of the galaxy\nevolutionary mass functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2004 19:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

VLA 1 is an embedded protostar, undetected in the\nnear-IR, and possibly in the Class 0 to Class I transition and powering a\nHerbig-Haro outflow. Its mid-IR emission appears slightly resolved with a\ndiameter of ~16 AU, possibly tracing circumstellar material from both the\nenvelope and the disk. VLA 2 is a typical Class I object, unresolved in the\nmid-IR, and is the responsible of the strong X-ray emission associated with YLW\n15. The expected centimeter ''peri-stellar'' emission associated with the X-ray\nemission is not detected with the VLBA at 6 cm likely due to the high optical\ndepth of the free-free emission. Strikingly, the near to mid-IR properties of\nYLW 15 suggest that VLA 1 is a more embedded YSO, or alternatively, less\nluminous than VLA 2, whereas orbital proper motions of this binary system\nindicate that VLA 1 is more massive than VLA 2. This result is apparently\nagainst the expected evolutionary scenario, where one expects that the more\nmassive YSO in a binary system is the more evolved and luminous YSO. Finally,\nthe nearby source YLW 16A is detected with the VLA, its position coincides with\nreported near-IR and X-ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2004 00:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The behavior in the donor electron\ncharge distribution is strongly influenced by interference from the plane-wave\nand periodic parts of the Bloch functions. For two donors, oscillations in the\nexchange coupling calculated within the Heitler-London (HL) approach are due to\nthe plane-wave parts of the Bloch functions alone, which are pinned to the\nimpurity sites. The robustness of this result is assessed by relaxing the phase\npinning to the donor sites. We introduce a more general theoretical scheme, the\nfloating-phase HL, from which the previously reported donor exchange\noscillatory behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed. The\nfloating-phase formalism provides a ``handle'' on how to theoretically\nanticipate the occurrence of oscillatory behavior in electronic properties\nassociated with electron bound states in more general confining potentials,\nsuch as in quantum dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2004 18:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2004 23:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2004 21:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our aims\nare achieved by introducing a new class of null sets in Banach spaces (called\n$\\Gamma$-null sets), whose definition involves both the notions of category and\nmeasure, and showing that the required differentiability holds almost\neverywhere with respect to it.

One is then forced to account for\nthem by the Normal Form, which is the dynamical equation obeyed by the\nzero-order term. This spoils the integrability of the normal form, and the\nsimple wave-nature of the zero-order approximation. To avoid both undesired\nresults, one must require that the obstacles be accounted for by the\nhigher-order terms in the expansion of the solution (the Near-Identity\nTransformation). We show that this goal can be achieved if the higher-order\nterms are allowed to depend explicitly on the independent variables,t and x (an\noption that is not considered in the standard NF analysis). In addition, a\nparticular algorithm for the construction of the NIT leads to a canonical form\nfor the obstacles; they are expressed in terms of the symmetries of the\nunperturbed equation. The canonical form ensures the explicit vanishing of the\nobstacles in the case of a single-wave zero-order solution. In the case of a\nmultiple-wave solution, the effect of the canonical obstacles on the\nhigher-order terms in the NIT is confined to the region of interaction among\nthe waves. This often facilitates the derivation of closed-form expressions for\nthe asymptotic effect of the obstacles.

The matrix has two arrays of straight Au wires, one\narray perpendicular to the other, that are separated and topped by insulating\nlayers. Microelectromagnets can produce strong magnetic fields to stably\nmanipulate magnetically tagged biological systems in a fluid. Moreover, by\ncontrolling the currents flowing through the wires, a microelectromagnet matrix\ncan move a peak in the magnetic field magnitude continuously over the surface\nof the device, generate multiple peaks simultaneously and control them\nindependently. These capabilities of a matrix can be used to trap, continuously\ntransport, assemble, separate and sort biological samples on micrometer length\nscales. Combining microelectromagnets with microfluidic systems, chip-based\nexperimental systems can be realized for novel applications in biological and\nbiomedical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2004 23:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this letter we will prove\nthat a the Stern-Gerlach device behaves as a true measurement apparatus, as\nexpected by the Copenaghen interpretation, by the Ehrenfest theorem. In this\nway we recover, by other means, a limit on the Stern-Gerlach device, given by\nBohm, based on scrambling of phases due to a large oscillation frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2004 19:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
