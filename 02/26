We\nshow, analytically and numerically, that the corresponding system of nonlinear\nequations admits several types of stationary soliton solutions and that\nsolitons which preserve helical symmetry are dynamically unstable: once formed,\nthey decay rapidly when they propagate. On the other hand, the soliton which\nspontaneously breaks the local translational and helical symmetries possess the\nlowest energy and is a robust localized entity. We also demonstrate that this\nsoliton is the result of an hybridization of the quasiparticle states from the\ntwo lowest degenerate bands and has an inner structure which can be described\nas a modulated multi-hump amplitude distribution of excitations on individual\nspines. The complex and composite structure of the soliton manifests itself\ndistinctly when the soliton is moving and some interspine oscillations take\nplace.

In recent\nyears many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining\nprograms, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the\ndetection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of\nproblems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they\nrely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.\n  In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting\nto formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined\nwith other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning\ntheory.\n  In this paper we outline different alternatives for combining defeasible\nargumentation and machine learning techniques. We suggest how different aspects\nof a generic argument-based framework can be integrated with other ML-based\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2004 18:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2004 17:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Conditional probabilities are\ncomputed for variables of the system to take certain values when the ``clock''\nspecifies a certain time. This framework is attractive in contexts where the\nassumption of usual quantum mechanics of the existence of an external,\nperfectly classical clock, appears unnatural, as in quantum cosmology. Until\nrecently, there were problems with such constructions in ordinary quantum\nmechanics with additional difficulties in the context of constrained theories\nlike general relativity. A scheme we recently introduced to consistently\ndiscretize general relativity removed such obstacles. Since the clock is now an\nobject subject to quantum fluctuations, the resulting evolution in the time is\nnot exactly unitary and pure states decohere into mixed states. Here we work\nout in detail the type of decoherence generated, and we find it to be of\nLindblad type. This is attractive since it implies that one can have loss of\ncoherence without violating the conservation of energy. We apply the framework\nto a simple cosmological model to illustrate how a quantitative estimate of the\neffect could be computed.

We fit the absorption\nlength of the J/psi to the data obtained at the CERN SPS by the NA50\nCollaboration for Pb-Pb collisions. Collisions of lower centrality allow us to\ndetermine the temperature and the energy density of the pion gas. For both\nthese quantities we find values close to those indicated by lattice gauge\ncalculations for the transition to a quark-gluon plasma. A simple extrapolation\nto more central collisions, which takes into account the increase of the energy\ndeposited due to the increased nucleon flux, fails to reproduce the break in\nJ/psi absorption indicated by NA50, thus lending support to the idea that an\nunconfined quark-gluon phase may have been produced. This conclusion could be\nsharpened by analysing in a similar way, as a function of centrality, other\nobservables such as strange particle production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2004 12:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The initially large cosmological\nconstant gives rise to primordial inflation, during which cosmological\nperturbations are stretched beyond the Hubble radius. The cumulative effect of\nthe long wavelength fluctuations back-reacts on the background geometry in a\nform which corresponds to the addition of a negative effective cosmological\nconstant to the energy-momentum tensor. In the absence of an effective scalar\nfield driving inflation, whose decay can reheat the Universe, the challenge is\nto find a mechanism which produces matter at the end of the relaxation process.\nIn this Letter, we point out that the decay of a condensate representing the\norder parameter for a ``flat'' direction in the field theory moduli space can\nnaturally provide a matter generation mechanism. The order parameter is\ndisplaced from its vacuum value by thermal or quantum fluctuations, it is\nfrozen until the Hubble constant drops to a sufficiently low value, and then\nbegins to oscillate about its ground state. During the period of oscillation it\ncan decay into Standard Model particles similar to how the inflaton decays in\nscalar-field-driven models of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2004 16:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These\nstructures are observed at all of the boundary layers, in the solar wind and\nmagnetosheath, and along auroral field lines at 4.5-6.5 Re.

Such a survey has not\nbeen carried out before, and it reveals certain characteristics of solitary\nstructures in a finite magnetic field, a topic still inadequately addressed by\ntheories. We find that there is a broad range of electric field amplitudes at\nany specific magnetic field strength, and there is a general trend for the\nelectric field amplitudes to increase as the strength of the magnetic field\nincreases over a range of 5 to 500 nT. We provide a possible explanation for\nthis trend that releates to the structures being Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode\nsolitary waves. There is no corresponding dependence of the duration of the\nstructures on the magnetic field strength, although a plot of these two\nquantities reveals the unexpected result that with the exception of the\nmagnetosheath, all of the time durations for all of the other regions are\ncomparable, wheras the magnetosheath time durations clearly are in a different\ncategory of much smaller time duration.

We will show that\nalgorithmic randomness is equivalent to a ``formal uncertainty principle''\nwhich implies Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness. We also show that\nthe derived uncertainty relation, for many computers, is physical.
