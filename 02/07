Mild evolution is seen up to redshift order unity with SFR ~\n(1 + z)^{2.7}. This is the first directly observed normal star-forming galaxy\nX-ray luminosity function (XLF) at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z>0).\nThis provides the most direct measure yet of the X-ray derived cosmic\nstar-formation history of the Universe. We make use of Bayesian statistical\nmethods to classify the galaxies and the two types of AGN, finding the most\nuseful discriminators to be the X-ray luminosity, X-ray hardness ratio, and\nX-ray to optical flux ratio. There is some residual AGN contamination in the\nsample at the bright end of the luminosity function. Incompleteness slightly\nflattens the XLF at the faint end of the luminosity function. The XLF has a\nlognormal distribution and agrees well with the radio and infrared luminosity\nfunctions. However, the XLF does not agree with the Schechter luminosity\nfunction for the H-alpha LF indicating that additional and different physical\nprocesses may be involved in the establishment of the lognormal form of the\nXLF. The agreement of our star formation history points with the other star\nformation determinations in different wavebands (IR, Radio, H-alpha) gives an\ninteresting constraint on the IMF, and X-rays may be measuring directly the\nbinary star formation history of the Universe. X-ray studies will continue to\nbe useful for probing the star formation history of the universe by avoiding\nproblems of obscuration. Star formation may therefore be measured in more\ndetail by deep surveys with future x-ray missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2004 20:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2004 14:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Motivated by a need in industry to efficiently handle granular\nmaterials and a desire to make fundamental advances in non-equilibrium physics,\nexperimental and theoretical investigations have shown size separation to be a\ncomplex phenomena. Large particles in a vibrated granular system invariably\nrise to the top. However, they may also sink to the bottom, or show other\npatterns depending on subtle variations in physical conditions. While size\nratio is a dominant factor, particle specific properties such as density,\ninelasticity and friction can play an important role.

The presence of\nconvection can enhance mixing or lead to size separation. Experimental\ntechniques including direct visualization and magnetic resonance imaging are\nbeing used to investigate these properties. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo\nsimulation techniques have been developed to probe size separation.

En route, we observe a Kramers' nondegeneracy: the existence of a\nnondegenerate eigenstate of any time reversal symmetric n-qubit Hamiltonian\ndemands (i) n even and (ii) maximal concurrence of said eigenstate. We provide\nexamples of how to apply this work to study the kinematics and dynamics of\nentanglement in spin chain Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2004 19:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2004 14:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

As we explain, the motivation for considering this\nproblem is that certain pure-state measures of quantum entanglement, which we\ncall polynomial entanglement measures, can be represented as affine algebraic\nvarieties. We consider the evaluation of certain mixed-state extensions of\nthese polynomial entanglement measures, namely convex and concave roofs. We\nshow that the evaluation of a roof-based mixed-state extension is equivalent to\ncalculating a hyperplane which is multiply tangent to the variety in a number\nof places equal to the number of terms in an optimal decomposition for the\nmeasure. In this way we provide an implicit representation of optimal\ndecompositions for mixed-state entanglement measures based on the roof\nconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2004 16:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2004 16:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
