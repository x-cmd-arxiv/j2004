I have estimated extinctions, luminosities, and effective\ntemperatures for the members and used these data to construct an H-R diagram\nfor the cluster.

The class is\nparameterized by this penalty factor q. An effectively infinite population size\nand thus deterministic dynamics is assumed. For the extreme cases q=0 and q=1,\nand any initial distribution whose moments satisfy certain conditions, we prove\nthe convergence to one of the known fixed points, uniquely determined by the\nmean copy number, in both discrete and continuous time. For the intermediate\nparameter values, the existence of fixed points is shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2004 15:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We compare the case of a linear\ncavity with standing wave modes to that of a ring cavity with two\ncounter-propagating traveling wave modes. It is found that the dynamics of the\natoms strongly depends on the quantization procedure for the cavity field. For\nstanding waves, no correlations develop between the cavity field and the atoms.\nConsequently, standing wave Fock states yield the same results as a classical\nstanding wave field while coherent states give rise to a collapse and revivals\nin the scattering of the atoms. In contrast, for traveling waves the scattering\nresults in quantum entanglement of the radiation field and the atoms. This\nleads to a collapse and revival of the scattering probability even for Fock\nstates. The Pauli Exclusion Principle manifests itself as an additional\ndephasing of the scattering probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2004 01:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
