In particular, X-ray\nimaging clearly shows two cavities within the ICM that are approximately\naligned with the radio-galaxy axis. However, using our new radio maps we fail\nto find a detailed correspondence between the 1 arcmin scale radio-lobes and\nthe ICM cavities. This suggests that the cavities are ``ghosts'' of a previous\nburst of powerful activity by PKS 2354-35. We also examine the nature of the\ncentral asymmetric ridge (or bar) of X-ray emission extending for 30kpc\nsouth-west of the cluster center that has been noted in these previous\nanalyzes. We find the ridge to be denser and cooler than, but probably in\npressure balance with, its surroundings. The thermal evolution of this\nstructure seems to be dominated by radiative cooling, possibly enhanced by the\nradio-galaxy ICM interaction. We discuss several possible models for the\nformation of this SW ridge and find none of them to be entirely satisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 17:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, apparent luminosity\noffsets may actually reflect rotation curve anomalies such as strong\nasymmetries or radial truncation, due to galaxy interactions or low S/N data.\nHere we analyze emission-line rotation curves from two low-z samples: the Close\nPairs Survey, which contains many interacting galaxies, and the Nearby Field\nGalaxy Survey (NFGS), which represents the general galaxy population. In the\nspirit of high-z samples, these surveys reflect the natural diversity of\nemission-line galaxies, including peculiar and early-type morphologies. We\nadopt objective criteria to identify severe kinematic anomalies. In the Close\nPairs Survey, TF offsets associated with such anomalies collectively resemble\nthe ``differential luminosity evolution'' claimed in some high-z studies, with\nlarger offsets at lower luminosities. With anomalous galaxies rejected,\nhowever, the TF relations for the two surveys are quite similar. Furthermore,\nthe two surveys follow similar relations between color and TF residuals, with\nthe Pairs Survey relation extending to bluer colors and brighter TF residuals.\nStrong outliers from this relation are nearly always kinematically anomalous.\nThus the color-TF residual relation can serve as a powerful tool for separating\nreliable luminosity offsets from offsets associated with kinematic anomalies.\nWe reanalyze high-z TF data from the FORS Deep Field and find: (1) overall\nluminosity evolution of ~0.3 mag; (2) strong slope evolution driven by\nkinematically anomalous galaxies, which show TF offsets of up to ~2 mag at low\nluminosities; and (3) an additional zero-point offset of ~0.2 mag linked to\nanomalous galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2004 01:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2004 22:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The triple-diffusive situation is more complex, and its\nstability criteria are not easily stated.

We will identify a class\nof models where the shift symmetry uniquely follows from the underlying\nmathematical structure of the theory. It is related to the symmetry properties\nof the corresponding coset space and the period matrix of special geometry,\nwhich shows how the gauge coupling depends on the volume and the position of\nthe branes. In particular, for type IIB string theory on K3xT^2/Z with D3 or D7\nmoduli belonging to vector multiplets, the shift symmetry is a part of\nSO(2,2+n) symmetry of the coset space [SU(1,1)/ U(1)]x[SO(2,2+n)/(SO(2)x\nSO(2+n)]. The absence of a prepotential, specific for the stringy version of\nsupergravity, plays a prominent role in this construction, which may provide a\nviable mechanism for the accelerated expansion and inflation in the early\nuniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 19:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2004 20:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The degree of broadening was\nvirtually independent of the position studied within the GEC cell, similar to\nthe recent finding for He/H2 and Ar/H2 plasmas in the same GEC cell. In\ncontrast to the atomic hydrogen lines, no broadening was observed in oxygen\nspecies lines at low pressures. Also, in control Xe/H2 plasmas run in the same\ncell at similar pressures and adsorbed power, no significant broadening of\natomic hydrogen, Xe, or any other lines was observed. Stark broadening or\nacceleration of charged species due to high electric fields can not explain the\nresults since (i) the electron density was insufficient by orders of magnitude,\n(ii) the RF field was essentially confined to the cathode fall region in\ncontrast to the broadening that was independent of position, and (iii) only the\natomic hydrogen lines were broadened.

Partially, the conflicting assertions are based upon\ndemographic evidence and the interpretation of survival and mortality curves\nusing the Gompertz model and the Weibull model; these models are sometimes\nconsidered to be incomplete in describing the entire curves. In this paper a\nnew model is proposed to take the place of the traditional models. We directly\nanalysed the rectangularity (the parts of the curves being shaped like a\nrectangle) of survival curves for 17 countries and for 1876-2001 in Switzerland\n(it being one of the longest-lived countries) with a new model. This model is\nderived from the Weibull survival function and is simply described by two\nparameters, in which the shape parameter indicates 'rectangularity' and\ncharacteristic life indicates the duration for survival to be 'exp(-1)'. The\nshape parameter is essentially a function of age and it distinguishes humans\nfrom technical devices. We find that although characteristic life has increased\nup to the present time, the slope of the shape parameter for middle age has\nbeen saturated in recent decades and that the rectangularity above\ncharacteristic life has been suppressed, suggesting there are ultimate limits\nto human longevity. The new model and subsequent findings will contribute\ngreatly to the interpretation and comprehension of our knowledge on the human\nageing processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 17:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2004 10:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
