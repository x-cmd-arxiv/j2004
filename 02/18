The presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearby\nlocation and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangent\npoint, implying a lower limit to the distance of ~6kpc. The presence of a\nsignificant red-shifted component at +30km/s is even more intriguing as GX339-4\nalso has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, and\nthis cloud, could be on the far side of the Galaxy, where the radial velocities\ndue to Galactic rotation become positive again. If this is the case, we require\na distance of ~15kpc. This is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. We\ndiscuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst and\nquiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that a\nlarge distance is consistent with these characteristics.

These deep observations, taken as part of a program to\nmeasure the star formation history in the halo, spanned a period of 41 days\nwith sampling on a variety of time scales, enabling the identification of short\nand long period variables. Although the long period variables cannot be fully\ncharacterized within the time span of this program, the enormous advance in\nsensitivity provided by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space\nTelescope allows accurate characterization of the RR Lyrae population in this\nfield. We find 29 RRab stars with a mean period of 0.594 days, 25 RRc stars\nwith a mean period of 0.316 days, and 1 RRd star with a fundamental period of\n0.473 days and a first overtone period of 0.353 days. These 55 RR Lyrae stars\nimply a specific frequency S_RR=5.6, which is large given the high mean\nmetallicity of the halo, but not surprising given that these stars arise from\nthe old, metal-poor tail of the distribution. This old population in the\nAndromeda halo cannot be clearly placed into one of the Oosterhoff types: the\nratio of RRc/RRabc stars is within the range seen in Oosterhoff II globular\nclusters, the mean RRab period is in the gap between Oosterhoff types, and the\nmean RRc period is in the range seen in Oosterhoff I globular clusters. The\nperiods of these RR Lyraes suggest a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.6, while\ntheir brightness implies a distance modulus to Andromeda of 24.5+/-0.1, in good\nagreement with the Cepheid distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2004 03:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In such theories the cosmological evolution\ngets dramatically modified at the crossover scale, usually exhibiting a\n\"self-accelerated\" expansion, which can be differentiated from more\nconventional \"dark energy\" scenarios by precision cosmology. However, unlike\nthe latter scenarios, theories of modified-gravity are extremely constrained\n(and potentially testable) by the precision gravitational measurements at much\nshorter scales. Despite the presence of extra polarizations of graviton, the\ntheory is compatible with observations, since the naive perturbative expansion\nin Newton's constant breaks down at a certain intermediate scale. This happens\nbecause the extra polarizations have couplings singular in $1/r_c$. However,\nthe correctly resummed non-linear solutions are regular and exhibit continuous\nEinsteinian limit.

A new\nclassification based on them is developed for symmetric nonzero-sum classical\n2x2 games, as well as classifications for quantum games with different\nrestricted subsets of the total strategy set. Finally, a classification is\npresented taking the whole set of strategies into account, both unitary\nstrategies and nonunitary strategies studied as convex mixures of unitary\nstrategies.\n  The classification reproduces features which have been previously found in\nother works, like appearance of multiple equilibria, changes in the character\nof equilibria, and entanglement regime transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2004 20:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2004 23:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown here however that in the cases in which a sentient being\nis explicitly assumed to take cognizance of the outcome the reasons we have for\njudging this way are not totally consistent, so that the question has to be\nconsidered anew. It is pointed out that the way the Broglie-Bohm model solves\nthe riddle suggests a possible clue, consisting in assuming that even very\nsimple systems may have some sort of a proto-consciousness, but that their\n``internal states of consciousness'' are not predictive. It is, next, easily\nshown that if we imagine the systems get larger, in virtue of decoherence their\ninternal states of consciousness progressively gain in predictive value. So\nthat, for macro-systems, they may be identified (in practice) with the\npredictive states of consciousness on which we ground our observational\npredictions. The possibilities of carrying over this idea to standard quantum\nmechanics are then investigated. Conditions of conceptual consistency are\nconsidered and found rather strict, and, finally, two solutions emerge,\ndiffering conceptually very much from one another but in both of which the,\npossibly non-predictive, generalized internal states of consciousness play a\ncrucial role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2004 09:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 09:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
