Central issue is the\ninterplay between chiral symmetry restoration and the formation of color\nsuperconducting phases. In order to lay a solid ground for this analysis, we\nbegin with a rather detailed discussion of two and three-flavor NJL models and\ntheir phase structure, neglecting the possibility of diquark pairing in a first\nstep. An important aspect of this part is a comparison with the MIT bag model.\nThe NJL model is also applied to investigate the possibility of absolutely\nstable strange quark matter. In the next step the formalism is extended to\ninclude diquark condensates. We discuss the role and mutual influence of\nseveral conventional and less conventional quark-antiquark and diquark\ncondensates. As a particularly interesting example, we analyze a spin-1 diquark\ncondensate as a possible pairing channel for those quarks which are left over\nfrom the standard spin-0 condensate. For three-flavor systems, we find that a\nself-consistent calculation of the strange quark mass, together with the\ndiquark condensates, is crucial for a realistic description of the 2SC-CFL\nphase transition. We also study the effect of neutrality constraints which are\nof relevance for compact stars. Both, homogeneous and mixed, neutral phases are\nconstructed. Although neutrality constraints generally tend to disfavor the 2SC\nphase we find that this phase is again stabilized by the large values of the\ndynamical strange quark mass which follow from the self-consistent treatment.\nFinally, we combine our solutions with existing hadronic equations of state to\ninvestigate the existence of quark matter cores in neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2004 09:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2005 09:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A gauge invariant\npotential action is constructed by adopting the scalar field and a real\nWilson-like line element of the gauge field. Of particular, the conformal\nscaling gauge symmetry can be broken down explicitly via fixing gauge to match\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action of gravity. As a nontrivial background field\nsolution of pure gauge has a minimal energy in gauge interactions, the\nevolution of universe is then dominated at earlier time by the potential energy\nof background field characterized by a scalar field. Since the background field\nof pure gauge leads to an exponential potential model of a scalar field, the\nuniverse is driven by a power-law inflation with the scale factor $a(t) \\sim\nt^p$. The power-law index $p$ is determined by a basic gauge fixing parameter\n$g_F$ via $p = 16\\pi g_F^2[1 + 3/(4\\pi g_F^2) ]$. For the gauge fixing scale\nbeing the Planck mass, we are led to a predictive model with $g_F=1$ and\n$p\\simeq 62$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2004 02:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We discuss the\nconjecture that cognitive behaviour is quantum-like. There is presented the\nscheme for an experimental test for quantum-like cognitive behaviour based on a\ngeneralization of the famous Bell's inequality. This generalization is an\nanalogue of Bell's inequality, but for conditional probabilities. The use of\nconditional probabilities (instead of simultaneous probability distributions\nfor pairs of observables in the original Bell's inequality) gives the\npossibility to separate two problems which are mixed in the original Bell's\nframework: nonlocality and nonclassical (quantum-like) probabilistic behaviour.\nOur inequality for conditional probabilities can be used for experiments with a\nsingle system (so we need not to prepare pairs of correlated systems) to find\nquantum-like behaviour. This possibility is extremely important in cognitive\nsciences where it is practically impossible to prepare pairs of precisely\ncorrelated cognitive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2004 15:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
