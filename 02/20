Such geometrical arrangement is\nexpected in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and in galactic X-ray binary systems\nbecause both hot and cold gases are present in the black hole vicinity.\nPrevious astrophysical literature concentrated on the evaporation of the cold\ndisk in the classical heat conduction limit. Here we consider the inverse\nprocess, i.e. condensation of the hot gas onto the cold disk. We find two\ndistinct condensation regimes. (i) In the classical thermal conduction limit,\nthe radiative cooling in the hot gas itself force condensation above a certain\ncritical accretion rate. Most of the flow energy in this case is re-emitted as\nX-ray radiation. (ii) Below a certain minimum accretion rate, the hot electrons\nare collisionless and the classical heat flux description becomes invalid. We\nuse the ``non-local'' heat flux approach borrowed from the terrestrial laser\nheated plasma experiments. Due to their very large mean free path, the hot\nparticles penetrate deep into the cold disk where the radiative losses are\nsignificant enough to enable condensation. In this case the hot flow energy is\ninconspicuously re-radiated by the transition layer in many UV and especially\noptical recombination lines (e.g., Ly$\\alpha$, $H\\alpha$, H$\\beta$) as well as\nvia the optically thick disk emission. We derive an approximate analytical\nsolution for the dynamics of the hot condensing flow.

Dust lanes are a generic feature of massive disks\nwith V_rot>120km/s, but are completely absent in galaxies with V_rot<120km/s.\nThe transition reflects an increase in the scale height of the cold ISM in low\nmass galaxies, driven by larger turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer,\nrather than sharp drops in the gas surface density. We identify the\nV_rot=120km/s transition with the onset of gravitational instabilities in high\nmass galaxies. The instabilities lead to fragmentation and gravitational\ncollapse along spiral arms, smaller gas scale heights, lower turbulent\nvelocities, and thus to narrow dust lanes.

BC_K is a well-behaved function\nof near-IR spectral type with a dispersion of ~0.1 mag for types M6-T5; it is\nsignificantly more scattered for types T5-T9. T_eff declines steeply and\nmonotonically for types M6-L7 and T4-T9, but is nearly constant at ~1450 K for\ntypes L7-T4 with assumed ages of ~3 Gyr. This constant T_eff is evidenced by\nnearly unchanging values of L'-M' between types L6 and T3.

As a simplest multi-mass model, we first\ninvestigated the two-component clusters. Rotation is found to accelerate the\ndynamical evolution through the transfer of angular momentum outward, as well\nas from the high masses to the low masses. However, the degree of acceleration\ndepends sensitively on the assumed initial mass function since dynamical\nfriction, which generates mass segregation, also tends to accelerate the\nevolution, and the combined effect of both is not linear or multiplicative. As\nlong as dynamical friction dominates in the competition with angular momentum\nexchange the heavy masses lose random energy and angular momentum, sink towards\nthe centre, but their remaining angular momentum is sufficient to speed them up\nrotationally. This is gravo-gyro instability. As a consequence, we find that\nthe high mass stars in the central parts rotate faster than low mass stars.\nThis leads to the suppression of mass segregation compared to the non-rotating\nclusters. From the study of multi-component models, we observe similar trends\nto the two-component models in almost all aspects. The mass function changes\nless drastically for clusters with rotation. Unlike non-rotating clusters, the\nmass function depends on $R$ and $z$.

This is\nbecause the superconformal anomaly dictates that supersymmetry breaking is\ntransmitted through nearly flavor-blind infrared physics that is highly\npredictive and UV insensitive. Slepton mass squareds, however, are predicted to\nbe negative. This can be solved by adding D-terms for U(1)_Y and U(1)_{B-L}\nwhile retaining the UV insensitivity. In this paper we consider electroweak\nsymmetry breaking via UV insensitive anomaly mediation in several models. For\nthe MSSM we find a stable vacuum when tanbeta < 1, but in this region the top\nYukawa coupling blows up only slightly above the supersymmetry breaking scale.\nFor the NMSSM, we find a stable electroweak breaking vacuum but with a chargino\nthat is too light. Replacing the cubic singlet term in the NMSSM superpotential\nwith a term linear in the singlet we find a stable vacuum and viable spectrum.\nMost of the parameter region with correct vacua requires a large superpotential\ncoupling, precisely what is expected in the ``Fat Higgs'' model in which the\nsuperpotential is generated dynamically. We have therefore found the first\nviable UV complete, UV insensitive supersymmetry breaking model that solves the\nflavor and CP problems automatically: the Fat Higgs model with UV insensitive\nanomaly mediation. Moreover, the cosmological gravitino problem is naturally\nsolved, opening up the possibility of realistic thermal leptogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2004 21:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
