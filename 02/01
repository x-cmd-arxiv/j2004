The CLEAN concept is\nbased on the detection of elastic scattering events (neutrino-electron\nscattering and neutrino-nuclear scattering) in liquified noble gases such as\nliquid helium, liquid neon, and liquid xenon, all of which scintillate brightly\nin the ultraviolet. Key to the CLEAN technique is the use of a thin film of\nwavelength-shifting fluor to convert the ultraviolet scintillation light to the\nvisible. This allows the same liquid to be used as both a passive shielding\nmedium and an active self-shielding detector, allowing lower intrinsic\nradioactive backgrounds at low energies. Liquid neon is a particularly\npromising medium for CLEAN. Because liquid neon has a high scintillation yield,\nhas no long-lived radioactive isotopes, and can be easily purified by use of\ncold traps, it is an ideal medium for the detection of rare nuclear events. In\naddition, neon is inexpensive, dense, and transparent to its own scintillation\nlight, making it practical for use in a large self-shielding apparatus. Monte\nCarlo simulations of gamma ray backgrounds have been performed assuming liquid\nneon as both shielding and detection medium. Gamma ray events occur with high\nprobability in the outer parts of the detector. In contrast, neutrino\nscattering events occur uniformly throughout the detector. We discriminate\nbackground gamma ray events from events of interest based on a spatial Maximum\nLikelihood method estimate of event location. Background estimates for CLEAN\nare presented, as well as an evaluation of the sensitivity of the detector for\n$p-p$ neutrinos. Given these simulations, the physics potential of the CLEAN\napproach is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2004 21:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2004 21:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is argued that these deep issues cannot be resolved\nwithin the standard approach to general relativity that considers {\\em every}\nsolution of Einstein's field equations to be of relevance to some, hypothetical\nor not, physical situation. Hence, to resolve the considered problems of the\nstandard approach to general relativity, one must go beyond it.
