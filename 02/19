A significant\nproblem in comparing the properties of groups and clusters is the derivation of\nsystem radii, to allow different systems to be compared within regions having\nthe same overdensity. We find evidence that group velocity dispersion provides\na very unreliable measure of system mass (and hence radius), with a number of\ngroups having remarkably low values of sigma. We confirm that the surface\nbrightness profiles of groups are significantly flatter than those of clusters,\nhowever we find no significant tendency within our sample for cooler groups to\nshow flatter profiles. This result is inconsistent with simple universal\npreheating models. The morphology of the galaxies in the GEMS groups is\ncorrelated to their X-ray properties in a number of ways: we confirm the very\nstrong relationship between X-ray emission and a dominant early-type central\ngalaxy, and also find that spiral fraction is correlated with the temperature\nof the hot gas.

They share with\n$M$ a Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature and allow for the\nisometric action of the group $Sl(2,C)$. The homotopy group $\\pi_1(M)$ acts as\na uniform lattice $\\Gamma(M)$ on $B^3$ and tesselates it by copies of $M$. Its\nelements $g$ produce preimage and image points for geodesic sections on $B^3$\nwhich by self-intersection form geodesic loops on $M$. For any fixed hyperbolic\n$g \\in \\Gamma$ we construct a continuous commutative two-parameter normalizer\n$N_g <Sl(2,C)$ and its orbit surfaces on $B^3$. The orbit surfaces classify\nsets of geodesic loops of equal length. We give general expressions for the\nlength of geodesic loops and for the defect angle at the self-intersection on\n$M$ in terms of the group parameters of $g$ and orbit parameters on $B^3$.\nGeodesic loops of minimal length, given from the character $\\chi(g)$, belong to\na single orbit. These and only these minimal geodesic loops have vanishing\ndefect angle and hence are smooth everywhere. The role of symmetries is\nilluminated by the example of the dodecahedral hyperbolic Weber-Seifert\nmanifold $M$. $\\Gamma(M)$ is normal in the hyperbolic Coxeter group with\nCoxeter diagram ${\\bf \\circ \\frac{5}{}\\circ\\frac{3}{}\\circ\\frac{5}{}\\circ}$.\nThis leads to symmetry relations between geodesic loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2004 08:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Moreover, double resonance can\nexhibit a regular pattern, in which the high-field (HF) line intensity\nsurpasses that of the low-field (LF) line, or it can exhibit an inverted\npattern with the HF line less intense than the LF line. There is a general\nbelief that the inverted FMR pattern occurs when the HF line is an \"optic\nmode\", i.e. an out-of-phase composition of individual sublayer modes, and the\nLF line is an \"acoustic mode\", or an in-phase mode composition.

In this paper, we present a density functional approach to\nstudy the possibility of entropy-driven microphase separation in diblock\ncopolymers. Our model system consists of copolymers composed of freely-jointed\nslender hard rods. The two types of monomeric segments have comparable lengths,\nbut a significantly different diameter, the latter difference providing the\ndriving force for the phase separation. At the same time these systems can also\nexhibit liquid crystalline phases. We treat this system in the appropriate\ngeneralization of the Onsager approximation to chain-like particles. Using a\nlinear stability (bifurcation) analysis, we analytically determine the onset of\nthe microseparated and the nematic phases for long chains. We find that for\nvery long chains the microseparated phase always preempts the nematic. In the\nlimit of infinitely long chains, the correlations within the chain become\nGaussian and the approach becomes exact. This allows us to define a Gaussian\nlimit in which the theory strongly simplifies and the competition between\nmicrophase separation and liquid crystal formation can be studied essentially\nanalytically. Our main results are phase diagrams as a function of the\neffective diameter difference, the segment composition and the length ratio of\nthe segments. We also determine the amplitude of the positional order as a\nfunction of position along the chain at the onset of the microphase separation\ninstability. Finally, we give suggestions as to how this type of\nentropy-induced microphase separation could be observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2004 09:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Assuming \\sim 10^{3} GW_{th} ton year operation\nof a reactor experiment, CP sensitivity at 90 % CL is shown to exists in\nsin^2{2theta_{13}} > 0.03 (0.04) with 2 years running of Hyper-Kamiokande (10\nyears running of SK). Second, I review the method which I call the BNL\nstrategy, in which one tries to explore CP violation through observing\noscillatory pattern of neutrino oscillation. Motivated by the approval of the\nJPARC neutrino program, I also discuss a low-energy realization of the BNL\nstrategy. It is meant to measure neutrino oscillation at the first and the\nsecond oscillation maxima by two HKs placed at Kamioka and somewhere in Korea.\nIt is suggested by very rough argument that 8 years running in nu_{e} and\nnu_{e}-bar modes with one HK at Kamioka is equivalent to 2 years running in\nnu_{e} mode with two HK complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2004 21:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An important example is laser cooling.\nIn such systems, there is an interplay of the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics,\nwhich is controllable and the dissipative part of the dynamics, which is\nuncontrollable. The strategy is to control the Hamiltonian portion of the\nevolution in such a way that the dissipation causes the purity of the system to\nincrease rather than decrease. The goal of this paper is to find the strategy\nthat leads to maximal purity at the final time. Under the assumption that\nHamiltonian control is complete and arbitrarily fast, we provide a general\nframework by which to calculate optimal cooling strategies. These assumptions\nlead to a great simplification, in which the control problem can be\nreformulated in terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of $\\rho$, rather than\n$\\rho$ itself. By combining this formulation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\ntheorem we are able to obtain an equation for the globaly optimal cooling\nstrategy in terms of the spectrum of the density matrix. For the three-level\n$\\Lambda$ system, we provide a complete analytic solution for the optimal\ncooling strategy. For this system it is found that the optimal strategy does\nnot exploit system coherences and is a 'greedy' strategy, in which the purity\nis increased maximally at each instant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2004 15:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
