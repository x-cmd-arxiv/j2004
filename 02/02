Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed\nabsolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +-500\nkm/s in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly a\nfactor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. At\nfixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on\nlocal density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are\nalmost independent of it. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is\nspecific star formation rate. For galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x\n10^10 M_sun, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from low\nto high densities. This decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. At fixed\nstellar mass, twice as many galaxies host AGN with strong [OIII] emission in\nlow density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments\nalso contain more dust. We have analyzed correlations between spectroscopic\nindicators that probe SFH on different timescales (D4000, Hdelta_A and SFR/M*).\nThe correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in\nstar formation has ocurred over long (>1 Gyr) timescales. Since structure does\nnot depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent SFH, dust\nand AGN for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,\ne.g. mergers. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small scale (< 1\nMpc) estimates of local density. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity\nbetween changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a\nfunction of redshift and we interpret this using N-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 10:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We argue that\nmorphological appearance and dynamical evolution of the gas is primarily\ndetermined by supersonic turbulence, and that stars form via a process we call\ngravoturbulent fragmentation. Turbulence that is dominated by large-scale\nshocks or is free to decay leads to an efficient, clustered, and synchronized\nmode of star formation. On the other hand, when turbulence carries most of its\nenergy on very small scales star formation is inefficient and biased towards\nsingle objects. The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary\ncan be explained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. Some\nfilaments may accumulate sufficient mass and density to become gravitationally\nunstable and form stars. This is observed in the Taurus molecular cloud.\nTimescales and spatial distribution of protostars are well explained by the\nlinear theory of gravitational fragmentation of filaments. The dynamical\nevolution, especially at late times, and the final mass distribution strongly\ndepend on the global properties of the turbulence. In dense embedded clusters\nmutual protostellar interactions and competition for the available mass\nreservoir lead to considerable stochastic variations between the mass growth\nhistories of individual stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 13:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The mass loading efficiency of bubbles is a key factor to\ndetermine the evolution of winds and their global impact on the IGM: the higher\nthe mass loading, the later the IGM is enriched with metals. Galaxies with 10^9\n< M_* < 10^10 M_sun are responsible for most of the metals ejected into the IGM\nat z=3, while galaxies with M_* < 10^9 M_sun give a non negligible contribution\nonly at higher redshifts, when larger galaxies have not yet assembled. We find\na higher mean IGM metallicity than Lyalpha forest observations suggest and we\nargue that the discrepancy may be explained by the high temperatures of a large\nfraction of the metals in winds, which may not leave detectable imprints in\nabsorption in the Lyalpha forest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 15:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2005 15:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

In order to examine the possibility of critical phenomena we have\nstudied the properties of the ion in solvents based on a model for water with\ncharges scaled which causes a change from strong symmetry breaking to no\nsymmetry breaking. The behavior of the susceptibility and the Shannon entropy\nnear the critical point show no divergences. We examine the behavior of a\nsimple model and show that divergences would only be expected in the limit of\nlow temperatures, and the essential difference between the solvent-induced\nsymmetry breaking and the mean field Ising model is that in the latter the\nobserved quantity is an average over many spins, while in the former\nobservations are made on individual molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 11:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We recall that binary-pulsar tests are\nqualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of\nnonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like\nneutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational\nradiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from\ngeneral relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar\nobservations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data\nhave been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer\nthe celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf\nsystem PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'',\nsolar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545\nis now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects\nfor the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The\npresence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA\nspace experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect\nfor LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used\nsecurely for these ground interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 13:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Already for the low temperature, $T\\ll {min} (T_{\\rm bl.f},\nm_{b})$, the fermion mass shell proves to be partially blurred due to multiple\nfermion rescatterings on virtual bosons, $m_{b}$ is the boson mass, $T_{\\rm\nbl.f}$ $(\\ll m_f)$ is the typical temperature corresponding to a complete\nblurring of the gap between fermion-antifermion continua, $m_f$ is the fermion\nmass.

For $T\\gsim m_{b}^* (T)$ (hot hadron liquid, blurred boson\ncontinuum), $m_{b}^* (T)$ is the effective boson mass, the abundance of all\nparticles dramatically increases. The effective fermion mass $m_f^* (T)$\ndecreases with the temperature increase.\n  For $T\\gsim T_{\\rm bl.f}$ fermions are essentially relativistic particles.\nDue to the interaction of the boson with fermion-antifermion pairs, $m_{b}^*\n(T)$ decreases leading to the possibility of the ``hot Bose condensation'' for\n$T>T_{cb}$. The phase transition might be of the second order or of the first\norder depending on the species under consideration.\n  We estimate $R_N \\sim 1.5$ for $T\\sim m_{\\pi}/2$; $T_{\\rm bl.f}$ proves to be\nnear $T_{cb}$; both values are in the vicinity of the pion mass $m_{\\pi}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2004 15:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2004 15:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
