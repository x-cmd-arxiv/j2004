The efficiency and timescale of stellar birth in Galactic gas clouds\nstrongly depend on the properties of the interstellar turbulent velocity field,\nwith slow, inefficient, isolated star formation being a hallmark of turbulent\nsupport, and fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurring in its\nabsence. Star formation on scales of galaxies as a whole is expected to be\ncontrolled by the balance between gravity andturbulence, just like star\nformation on scales of individual interstellar gas clouds, but may be modulated\nby additional effects like cooling and differential rotation. The dominant\nmechanism for driving interstellar turbulence in star-forming regions of\ngalactic disks appears to be supernovae explosions.

Optical emission-line\nstudies of ULX nebulae provide useful measurements of X-ray energetics, and can\nthus determine if the X-rays are emitted isotropically. Analysis of an optical\nspectrum of the Ho II ULX nebulae implies an X-ray energy source with ~10^40\nerg/s is present, suggesting an isotropically-emitting IMBH. The spatial\ncoincidence of ULXs with dense star clusters (young clusters and globular\nclusters) suggests that IMBHs formed in these clusters could be the compact\nobjects in the associated ULXs. Quasi-periodic oscillations and frequency\nbreaks in XMM power-density spectra of ULXs also suggest that the black hole\nmasses are more consistent with IMBHs than stellar-mass black holes. Since\n_all_ of these ULXs with evidence for IMBHs are high-luminosity ULXs, i.e., L_X\n>~ 10^40 ergs, we suggest that this class of ULXs is generally powered by\naccreting IMBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2004 19:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

The pulsar radio emission produced inside\nthe magnetosphere propagates outward through the rotating magnetosphere,\nsubject to refraction by the intervening plasma that is spatially\ninhomogeneous. Both effects of a relativistic distribution of the plasma and\nrotation on wave propagation are considered. It is shown that refraction\ncoupled with rotation can produce asymmetric conal structures of the profile.\nThe differential refraction due to the rotation can cause the conal structures\nto skew toward the rotation direction and lead to asymmetry in relative\nintensities between the leading and trailing components. Both of these features\nare potentially observable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2004 12:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Under this condition the evolution of the mass distribution in\nlinear perturbation theory is the same as in the LambdaCDM cosmology, and both\nmodels therefore can equally well pass the available cosmological tests.

Our\nanalysis allows us to predict a critical speed for the onset of flapping as\nwell as the frequency of flapping. We find that in a particular limit\ncorresponding to a low density fluid flowing over a soft high density flag, the\nflapping instability is akin to a resonance between the mode of oscillation of\na rigid pivoted airfoil in a flow and a hinged-free elastic filament vibrating\nin its lowest mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2004 21:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
