Using photoionization calculations to\nemulate the observed ion column densities we constrain the quasar's spectral\nenergy distribution. Absorbers in the velocity range of 200 - 600 km/s can be\nmodelled successfully with a spectral index of alpha ~ -3 at energies higher\nthan 3 - 4 Ryd, which is an energy distribution similar to the QSO continuum\nsuggested by Mathews & Ferland (1987). The analysis of a group of high velocity\nabsorbers (v > 1300 km/s) leads to a harder energy distribution. The large\namount of helium (log N(HeII) > 16.3) associated with these absorbers implies\nthat they are responsible for the observed absence of the proximity effect\n(Reimers et al. 1997).

As stars close to\nthe galactic centre have short orbital periods it has been possible to trace\nlarge fractions of their orbits in the recent years. Previously the data of the\norbit of the star S2 have been fitted with Keplerian orbits corresponding to a\nmassive black hole (MBH) with a mass of M$_{BH}$=3-4$\\times10^6$M_sun implying\nan insignificant cusp mass.However, it has also been shown that the central\nblack hole resides in a ~1'' diameter stellar cluster of a priori unknown mass.\nIn a spherical potential which is neither Keplerian nor harmonic, orbits will\nprecess resulting in inclined rosetta shaped trajectories on the sky. In this\ncase, the assumption of non-Keplerian orbits is a more physical approach. It is\nalso the only approach through which cusp mass information can be obtained via\nstellar dynamics of the cusp members. This paper presents the first exemplary\nmodelling efforts in this direction. Using positional and radial data of star\nS2, we find that there could exist an unobserved extended mass component of\nseveral 10$^5$M$_{\\odot}$ forming a so-called 'cusp' centred on the black hole\nposition.

The\ndisk comprises a thermal gas, cosmic rays and a magnetic field perpendicular to\nthe gravitational accelerartion. Cosmic ray diffusion along the magnetic field\nis considered; cross field-line diffusion is supposed to be small and is\nignored. We investigated two cases in our simulations. In the mechanical\nperturbation case we add a velocity perturbation parallel to the magnetic field\nlines, while in the explosional perturbation case we add cosmic ray energy into\na sphere where the cosmic rays are injected. Linear analysis shows that the\ngrowth rate of the Parker instability becomes smaller if the coupling between\nthe CR and the gas is stronger (i.e., the CR diffusion coefficient is smaller).\nOur MHD simulations of the mechanical perturbation confirm this result. We show\nthat the falling matter is impeded by the CR pressure gradient, this causes a\ndecrease in the growth rate. In the explosional perturbation case, the growth\nof the magnetic loop is faster when the coupling is stronger in the early\nstage. However, in the later stage the behavior of the growth rate becomes\nsimilar to the mechanical perturbation case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2004 05:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We confine our\nattention here to the BEC and near-BEC regime where analytical calculations are\npossible. At finite $T$, non-condensed fermion pairs must be included, although\nthey have been generally ignored in the literature. Within this BEC regime we\ncompute the equations of state for the one and two channel models; these two\ncases correspond to whether Feshbach resonance effects are omitted or included.\nDifferences between these two cases can be traced to differences between the\nnature of a Cooper pair and bosonic condensate. Our results are also compared\nwith the Gross Pitaevskii equations of state for true bosons. Differences found\nhere are associated with the underlying fermionic character of the system.\nFinally, the particle density distribution functions for a trap containing\nsuperfluid fermionic atoms are computed using a Thomas-Fermi approach. The one\nand two channel behavior is found to be very different; we find a narrowing of\nthe density profile as a result of Feshbach resonance effects. Importantly, we\ninfer that the ratio between bosonic and fermionic scattering lengths depends\non the magnetic detuning and is generally smaller than 2. Future experiments\nwill be required to determine to what extent this ratio varies with magnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2004 01:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 May 2004 23:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-13"}

It is generally accepted that these objects are black\nholes. As observations improve, it becomes possible to test this hypothesis in\never greater detail. In particular, it is or will be possible to measure the\nproperties of orbits deep in the strong field of a black hole candidate (using\nx-ray timing or with gravitational-waves) and to test whether they have the\ncharacteristics of black hole orbits in general relativity. Such measurements\ncan be used to map the spacetime of a massive compact object, testing whether\nthe object's multipoles satisfy the strict constraints of the black hole\nhypothesis. Such a test requires that we compare against objects with the\n``wrong'' multipole structure. In this paper, we present tools for constructing\nbumpy black holes: objects that are almost black holes, but that have some\nmultipoles with the wrong value. The spacetimes which we present are good deep\ninto the strong field of the object -- we do not use a large r expansion,\nexcept to make contact with weak field intuition. Also, our spacetimes reduce\nto the black hole spacetimes of general relativity when the ``bumpiness'' is\nset to zero. We propose bumpy black holes as the foundation for a null\nexperiment: if black hole candidates are the black holes of general relativity,\ntheir bumpiness should be zero. By comparing orbits in a bumpy spacetime with\nthose of an astrophysical source, observations should be able to test this\nhypothesis, stringently testing whether they are the black holes of general\nrelativity.

However, a difficulty with using Jarzynski's\nequality is that Delta F estimates converge very slowly and unreliably due to\nthe nonlinear nature of the calculation -- thus requiring large, costly data\nsets. Here, we present new analyses of non-equilibrium data from various\nsimulated molecular systems exploiting statistical properties of Jarzynski's\nequality. Using a fully automated procedure, with no user-input parameters, our\nresults suggest that good estimates of Delta F can be obtained using 6-15 fold\nless data than was previously possible. Systematizing and extending previous\nwork [1], the new results exploit the systematic behavior of bias due to finite\nsample size. A key innovation is better use of the more statistically reliable\ninformation available from the raw data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2004 16:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this manner a greater flexibility to\nthe structure of the wave function is achieved. A constrained search in a\nsubspace over all functions $\\chi$ such that the wave function functional\n$\\psi[\\chi]$ satisfies a constraint such as normalization or the Fermi-Coulomb\nhole charge sum rule, or the requirement that it lead to a physical observable\nsuch as the density, diamagnetic susceptibility, etc. is then performed. A\nrigorous upper bound to the energy is subsequently obtained by variational\nminimization with respect to the parameters in the approximate wave function\nfunctional. Hence, the terminology, the constrained-search variational method.\nThe \\emph{rigorous} construction of such a constrained-search--variational wave\nfunction functional is demonstrated by example of the ground state of the\nHelium atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2004 19:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2004 18:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2004 01:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2004 17:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2005 16:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
