These fluctuations can be described by the\nEinstein-Langevin equation obtained in the framework of stochastic gravity.\nSpecifically, the Einstein-Langevin equation yields stochastic correlation\nfunctions for the metric perturbations which agree, to leading order in the\nlarge $N$ limit, with the quantum correlation functions of the theory of\ngravity interacting with $N$ matter fields. The homogeneous solutions of the\nEinstein-Langevin equation are equivalent to the solutions of the perturbed\nsemiclassical equation, which describe the evolution of the expectation value\nof the quantum metric perturbations. The information on the intrinsic\nfluctuations, which are connected to the initial fluctuations of the metric\nperturbations, can also be retrieved entirely from the homogeneous solutions.\nHowever, the induced metric fluctuations proportional to the noise kernel can\nonly be obtained from the Einstein-Langevin equation (the inhomogeneous term).\nThese equations exhibit runaway solutions with exponential instabilities. A\ndetailed discussion about different methods to deal with these instabilities is\ngiven.

That result\nraises the question as to whether an accurate solution can be achieved by a\nnumerically stable subgrid-scale model. In the present paper, based on\nassumptions regarding the statistically averaged velocity, we present similar\ntheoretical investigations to show that in several situations, the shears\nappearing in the statistically averaged velocity field numerically destabilize\nthe fluctuation components because of the derivation of a numerically unstable\nterm that represents negative diffusion in a fixed direction. This finding can\nexplain the problematic numerical instability that has been encountered in\nlarge eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The present result suggests that\nthis numerical problem is universal in large eddy simulations, and that if\nthere is no failure in modeling, the resulting subgrid-scale model can still\nhave unstable characteristics; that is, the known instability problems of\nseveral existing subgrid-scale models are not something that one may remove\nsimply by an artificial technique, but must be taken seriously so as to treat\nthem accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 11:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2004 06:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of\nthe distinct features of this photodetection scheme is its sensitivity to\nzero-point fluctuation due to the existence of the spontaneous emission. We\nhave recently succeeded in experimentally demonstrating the antinormally\nordered photodetection by exploiting nondegenerate stimulated parametric\ndown-conversion process. To properly account for the experiment, the detection\nprocess needs to be treated with time-dependent and continuous-mode operators\nbecause of the broadband nature of the parametric down-conversion process and\nthe wide spectrum of the pump that we used. Here, we theoretically analyze the\nantinormally ordered intensity correlation of the continuous-mode fields by\npursuing the detection process in the Heisenberg picture. It is shown that the\nexcess positive correlation due to zero-point fluctuation reduces because of\nthe frequency-distinguishability of the two emitted photon pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 10:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For this purpose I propose an epistemological criterion to decide\nwhether or not a physical theory is holistic, namely: a physical theory is\nholistic if and only if it is impossible in principle to infer the global\nproperties, as assigned in the theory, by local resources available to an\nagent. I propose that these resources include at least all local operations and\nclassical communication. This approach is contrasted with the well-known\napproaches to holism in terms of supervenience. The criterion for holism\nproposed here involves a shift in emphasis from ontology to epistemology. I\napply this epistemological criterion to classical physics and Bohmian mechanics\nas represented on a phase and configuration space respectively, and for quantum\nmechanics (in the orthodox interpretation) using the formalism of general\nquantum operations as completely positive trace non-increasing maps.\nFurthermore, I provide an interesting example from which one can conclude that\nquantum mechanics is holistic in the above mentioned sense, although, perhaps\nsurprisingly, no entanglement is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 14:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2004 17:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2005 19:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-20"}
