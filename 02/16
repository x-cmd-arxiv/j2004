It is demonstrated, by purely geometrical techniques,\nthat the curvature tensors, and the Einstein tensor in particular, exhibit a\nvery high degree of symmetry as the horizon is approached. Consequently, the\nstress-energy tensor will be highly constrained near any static Killing\nhorizon. More specifically, it is shown that -- at the horizon -- the\nstress-energy tensor block-diagonalizes into ``transverse'' and ``parallel''\nblocks, the transverse components of this tensor are proportional to the\ntransverse metric, and these properties remain invariant under static conformal\ndeformations. Moreover, we speculate that this geometric symmetry underlies\nCarlip's notion of an asymptotic near-horizon conformal symmetry controlling\nthe entropy of a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2004 21:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2004 21:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We analyse the relationship between the Frobenius semistability\nof the kernel sheaf associated with the curve and its ample line bundle, and\nthe HK multiplicity. This leads to a lower bound, achieved iff the kernel sheaf\nis Frobenius semistable, and otherwise to formulas for the HK multiplicity in\nterms of parameters measuring the failure of Frobenius semistability. As a\nbyproduct, an explicit example of a vector bundle on a curve is given whose\n$n$-th iterated Frobenius pullback is not semistable, while its $(n-1)$-th such\npullback is semistable, where $n>0$ is arbitrary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2004 18:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2004 10:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2004 12:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 11:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We then discuss the combinations of these strategies which have\nrecently been proposed in the literature. Finally we present recent results in\nreducing errors on encoded subspaces using decoupling controls.

Classical optics is able to provide an understanding of either the\ncorpuscular or wave aspects of quantum mechanics, reflected in phase space\nthrough the classical limit of the quantum Wigner distribution function or the\nWigner distribution function in classical optics, respectively. However,\nclassical optics, as any classical theory, cannot mimic the wave-particle\nduality that is at the heart of quantum mechanics. Moreover, it is never enough\nunderlined that, although the mathematical phase space formalisms in classical\noptics and quantum mechanics are very similar, the main difference between\nthese theories, evidenced in the results of measurements, is as deep as it can\nget even in phase space. On the other hand, the phase space treatment allows an\nunexpected similar treatment of interference phenomena, although quantum and\nclassical superpositions of wavefunctions and fields, respectively, have a\ncompletely different behavior. This similarity originates in the bilinear\ncharacter of the Wigner distribution function in both quantum mechanics and\nclassical optical wave theory. Actually, the phase space treatment of the\nquantum and classical wave theory is identical from the mathematical point of\nview, if the Planck constant is replaced by the wavelength of light. Even\nWigner distribution functions of particular quantum states, such as the\nSchrodinger cat state, can be mimicked by classical optical means, but not the\ntrue quantum character, which resides in the probability significance of the\nwavefunction, in comparison to the physical realness of classical wave fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2004 07:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
