Classical concepts like\nthe {\\it barycentric tensor of inertia} turn out to be extensible to special\nrelativity only by means of the quadrupole moments of the isolated system. Two\nnew applications of the multipole technique are worked out for systems of\ninteracting particles and fields. In the rest-frame of the isolated system of\neither free or interacting positive energy particles it is possible to define a\nunique world-line which embodies the properties of the most relevant centroids\nintroduced in the literature as candidates for the collective motion of the\nsystem. This is no longer true, however, in the case of open subsystems of the\nisolated system. While effective mass, 3-momentum and angular momentum in the\nrest frame can be calculated from the definition of the {\\it subsystem\nenergy-momentum tensor}, the definitions of effective center of motion and\neffective intrinsic spin of the subsystem are not unique. Actually, each of the\npreviously considered centroids corresponds to a different world-line in the\ncase of open systems. The pole-dipole description of open subsystems is\ncompared to their description as effective extended objects.
