We investigate the potential of track\nlength integral and shower size at maximum as estimators of shower energy. We\nfind that at very high energy (~10^19-10^20 eV) the error of the total energy\nassignment is dominated by the dependence on the hadronic interaction model,\nand is of the order of 5%. At lower energy (~10^17-10^18 eV), the uncertainty\nof the energy determination due to the limited knowledge of the primary cosmic\nray composition is more important. The distribution of depth of shower maximum\nis discussed as a measure of the proton-air cross section. Uncertainties in a\npossible experimental measurement of this cross section introduced by intrinsic\nshower fluctuations, the model of hadronic interactions, and the unknown\nmixture of primary nuclei in the cosmic radiation are numerically evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2004 10:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

The phase diagram contains a non-Fermi liquid fixed\npoint separating a screened phase, where conventional Kondo effect occurs, from\nan unscreened one, where the exchange-splitting takes care of quenching the\nimpurity degrees of freedom. On the Kondo screened side close to this fixed\npoint the impurity density of states shows a narrow Kondo-peak on top of a\nbroader resonance. This narrow peak transforms in the unscreened phase into a\nnarrow pseudo-gap inside the broad resonance. Right at the fixed point only the\nlatter survives. The fixed point is therefore identified by a jump of the\ndensity of states at the chemical potential. We also show that particle-hole\nperturbations which simply shift the orbital energies do not wash out the fixed\npoint, unlike those perturbations which hybridize the two orbitals.\nConsequently the density-of-state jump at the chemical potential remains finite\neven away from particle-hole symmetry, and the pseudo-gap stays pinned at the\nchemical potential, although it is partially filled in. We also discuss the\nrelevance of these results for lattice models which map onto this Anderson\nimpurity model in the limit of large lattice-coordination. Upon approaching the\nMott metal-insulator transition, these lattice models necessarily enter a\nregion with a local criticality which reflects the impurity non-Fermi liquid\nfixed point.

By using a variational approach, we\ncalculate monopole and quadrupole collective oscillations of the BEC.

In particular, it was inferred that, at optimal pressure, the formation\nof peaks in the anode current at inelastic thresholds is mediated inside the\ndetection cell by the large variation, a maximum at 0.4 eV, in the cross\nsection for elastic scattering. This variation is due to a shape resonance in\nthe electron-mercury system and is observable persuasively at the onset of\nanode current as a sharp peak followed by a clear minimum. In the present\npaper, the passage of electrons through the second grid to anode region is\nanalyzed in terms of kinetic theory. The discussion is based on a simplified\nexpression for the electron current derivable from an approximate form of the\nBoltzmann transport equation that maintains the spatial density gradient but\nomits elastic energy losses. The estimated range of pressure underlying this\nkind of idealization is in good agreement with experiment. An explicit solution\nis obtained by constructing an analytic expression for the momentum transfer\ncross section of mercury using a recent theory of generalized Fano profiles for\noverlapping resonances. This solution is used in order to model successfully\nthe formation of peaks at the threshold of anode current and at excitation\npotentials, and to explain the dependence of the observed profiles on the\npressure and on the sign and magnitude of the potential across the detection\ncell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2004 19:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The proposed method involves an atomic BEC with three internal states, a\nweak quantized probe laser and a strong classical coupling laser, which form a\nthree-level Lambda-shaped BEC system. We consider a situation where the BEC is\nin electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the coupling laser being\nmuch stronger than the probe laser. In this case, the upper and intermediate\nlevels are unpopulated, so that their adiabatic elimination enables an\neffective two-mode model involving only the atomic field at the lowest internal\nlevel and the quantized probe laser field. Atom-photon quantum entanglement is\ncreated through laser-atom and inter-atomic interactions, and two-photon\ndetuning. We show how to generate atom-photon entangled coherent states and\nentangled states between photon (atom) coherent states and atom-(photon-)\nmacroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) states, and between photon-MQS and\natom-MQS states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2004 07:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
