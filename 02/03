This effect is one of the largest\nsources of uncertainty in white dwarf cooling models, which are now routinely\nused to estimate the ages of stellar populations in both the Galactic disk and\nthe halo. We are attempting to minimize this source of uncertainty by\ncalibrating the models, using observations of pulsating white dwarfs. In a\ntypical mass white dwarf model, crystallization does not begin until the\nsurface temperature reaches 6000-8000 K. In more massive white dwarf models the\neffect begins at higher surface temperatures, where pulsations are observed in\nthe ZZ Ceti (DAV) stars. We use the observed pulsation periods of BPM 37093,\nthe most massive DAV white dwarf presently known, to probe the interior and\ndetermine the size of the crystallized core empirically.

It is observed that in\nmany cases traffic domains perform the two characteristic dynamical processes\nof the chipping model, namely chipping and diffusion. This correspondence\nindicates that jamming in traffic models in which all dynamical rates are\nnon-deterministic takes place as a broad crossover phenomenon, rather than a\nsharp transition.

Still the flavor\ndependence of the nucleon's spin is a significant fundamental question that is\nnot understood. Experiments measuring the spin content of the nucleon have\nreported conflicting results on the amount of nucleon spin carried by strange\nquarks. Quasi-elastic neutrino scattering, observed using a novel detection\ntechnique, provides a theoretically clean measure of this quantity.\n  The optimum neutrino beam energy needed to measure the strange spin of the\nnucleon is 1 GeV. This is also an ideal energy to search for neutrino\noscillations at high $\\Delta m^2$ in an astrophysically interesting region.\nModels of the r-process in supernovae which include high-mass sterile neutrinos\nmay explain the abundance of neutron-rich heavy metals in the universe.

This paper investigates an\nalternative way to construct quantum theories in which the conventional\nrequirement of Hermiticity (combined transpose and complex conjugate) is\nreplaced by the more physically transparent condition of space-time reflection\n(PT) symmetry. It is shown that if the PT symmetry of a Hamiltonian H is not\nbroken, then the spectrum of H is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian\nquantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4. The crucial\nquestion is whether PT-symmetric Hamiltonians specify physically acceptable\nquantum theories in which the norms of states are positive and the time\nevolution is unitary. The answer is that a Hamiltonian that has an unbroken PT\nsymmetry also possesses a physical symmetry represented by a linear operator\ncalled C. Using C it is shown how to construct an inner product whose\nassociated norm is positive definite. The result is a new class of fully\nconsistent complex quantum theories. Observables are defined, probabilities are\npositive, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. After a\nreview of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, new results are presented here in\nwhich the C operator is calculated perturbatively in quantum mechanical\ntheories having several degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2004 15:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-10-07"}
