Apart from dwarfs\nwhich are described either by a modified Plummer profile or by a\ntidally-truncated King profiles, fluxes are compared for halos with central\ncusps and cores. It is demonstrated that substructures, irrespective of their\nprofiles, enhance the gamma-ray emission only marginally. The expected\ngamma-ray intensity above 1 GeV at high galactic latitudes is consistent with\nthe residual emission derived from EGRET data if the density profile has a\ncentral core and the neutralino mass is less than 50 GeV, whereas for a central\ncusp only a substantial enhancement would explain the observations. From M31,\nthe flux can be detected above 0.1 GeV and 1.0 GeV by GLAST only if the\nneutralino mass is below 300 GeV and if the density profile has a central cusp,\ncase in which a significant boost in the gamma-ray emission is produced by the\ncentral black hole. For Sagittarius, the flux above 0.1 GeV is detectable by\nGLAST provided the neutralino mass is below 50 GeV. From M87 and Draco the\nfluxes are always below the sensitivity limit of GLAST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2004 09:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 May 2004 16:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper, we developed a new\nconjugate-gradient method for the numerical solution of spin-dependent extended\nThomas-Fermi equation by incorporating techniques previously used in Kohn-Sham\ncalculations. The key ingredient of the new method is an approximate\nline-search scheme and a collective treatment of two spin densities in the case\nof spin-dependent ETF problem. Test calculations for a quartic two-dimensional\nquantum dot system and a three-dimensional sodium cluster,$\\mr{Na}_{216}$, with\na local pseudopotential demonstrate that the method is accurate and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2004 16:03:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2004 21:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

If the condensate is suddenly\nlet to freely expand, the initial phonons lose their collective character by\ntransferring their energy and momentum to the motion of individual atoms. The\nbasic mechanisms of this evaporation process are investigated by using the\nGross-Pitaevskii theory and dynamically rescaled Bogoliubov equations.\nDifferent regimes of evaporation are shown to occur depending on the phonon\nwavelength. Distinctive signatures of the evaporated phonons are visible in the\ndensity distribution of the expanded gas, thus providing a new type of\nspectroscopy of Bogoliubov excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2004 11:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A recently developed variational approach turns out superior to\nthe conventional methods that include quantum effects on the level of local\nRPA. Dissipation is taken into account by applying energy smearing, simulating\nin this way the coupling to more complicated states. In principle, such a\ncoupling must depend on temperature. Previous calculations along another\nmicroscopic approach show this fact to imply an intriguing variation of the\ntransport coefficients of collective motion with T. The relevance of this\nfeature is demonstrated for the thermal fission rate and for the formation\nprobability of super-heavy elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2004 09:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Their\npositions are recorded during a yearly earth orbit, so stellar aberration can\nbe visualized as a tiny circle. But no aberration has been observed from local\nsources, hence the laser spot should remain still. The simultaneous recording\nof both spots allows highlighting their different behavior. Einstein related\naberration to the transverse speed between light source and observer, and since\nfor local sources it is null, no aberration ensues. Despite this explanation\nconforms with the correct result for local sources, it cannot however be\nretained since stellar aberration does not vary although relative speed differs\nfor each star. Consequently, the null transverse velocity cannot be considered\nthe cause of the null aberration from local sources.

We\npropose an alternative way to observe sub-wavelength interference by a\njoint-intensity measurement which occurs for only type I crystal in a higher\ngain of SPDC. When a signal beam injects into the crystal, it may create two\ninterference patterns by two stimulated down-converted beams, showing no\nsub-wavelength interference effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2004 02:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
