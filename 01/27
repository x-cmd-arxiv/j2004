However, unlike normal metals, the HTS device\nperformance suffers from intrinsically nonlinear electrodynamics, resulting in\nharmonic generation and intermodulation (IM) distortion at all levels of\ncirculating power. The dominant sources of IM response are believed to be\ninductive and localized in only small regions of the HTS film having the\nhighest current densities J_RF(x,y). In our previous papers, examining\nmicrowave resonators of simple microstrip geometry, we have demonstrated that\nlocal nonlinearity imaging is possible with the technique of low temperature\nlaser scanning microscopy (LTLSM) adapted to microwave experiments. Unique\ncontrast due to IM current density J_IM(x,y) was generated by the IM imaging\nmethod. It was applied to display the regions showing large nonlinear LTLSM\nphotoresponse (PR) in HTS devices with a few-micrometer spatial resolution.\nDirect local correlation between J_IM(x,y) and high J_RF(x,y) at the edges of\nthe strips, typical defects like twindomain blocks, in-plane rotated grains and\nmicro-cracks was shown. Here we want to indicate that the geometrical features\nin HTS circuit layout for microwave devices of more complex geometry also\nradically affect the linear device performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2004 18:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The identification of the\nradion as a canonically normalized field involves a careful General Relativity\ntreatment: if a bulk scalar is responsible for the stabilization of the system,\nits fluctuations are entangled with the perturbations of the metric and they\nalso have to be taken into account (similarly to the well-developed theory of\nscalar metric perturbations in 4D cosmology with a scalar field). Extracting a\nproper dynamical variable in a warped geometry/scalar setting is a nontrivial\ntask, performed so far only in the limit of negligible backreaction of the\nscalar field on the background geometry. We perform the general calculation,\ndiagonalizing the action up to second order in the perturbations and\nidentifying the physical eigenmodes of the system for any amplitude of the bulk\nscalar. This computation allows us to derive a very simple expression for the\nexact coupling of the eigenmodes to the Standard Model fields on the brane,\nvalid for an arbitrary background configuration. As an application, we discuss\nthe Goldberger-Wise mechanism for the stabilization of the radion in the\nRandall-Sundrum type models. The existing studies, limited to small amplitude\nof the bulk scalar field, are characterized by a radion mass which is\nsignificantly below the physical scale at the observable brane. We extend them\nbeyond the small backreaction regime. For intermediate amplitudes, the radion\nmass approaches the electroweak scale, while its coupling to the observable\nbrane remains nearly constant. At very high amplitudes, the radion mass instead\ndecreases, while the coupling sharply increases. Severe experimental\nconstraints are expected in this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2004 20:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Arguments supporting these assumptions are given. When the $E_8$ theory\nis coupled to supergravity, assuming vanishing of the cosmological constant and\na supersymmetry breaking scale of around a TeV, we show that the gluino mass\ninduced by gravitational coupling to the condensate is of order $10^{-3}$ eV or\nsmaller, compatible with the fermion (and particularly the neutrino) mass\nspectrum. We suggest that composite scalar Higgs superfields can arise from a\nchiral glueball in the attractive 3875 channel (and possibly other channels),\npermitting the breaking of the original $E_8$ gauge group to a SO(10) grand\nunification group, times a SU(3) family symmetry group and an extra U(1)\nfactor. A general analysis of the Higgs superpotential shows that in the\nabsence of gravitational couplings, there is always a supersymmetric vacuum in\nthe (unphysical) limit of infinite Higgs superfields. However, when\ngravitational couplings are included, dimensional analysis of the\nsuperpotential shows that the vacuum can be stabilized for finite Higgs\nsuperfields, with the occurrence of dynamical ${\\cal F}$-type supersymmetry\nbreaking.

The representation is constructed by regarding the wave function\nas the internal state of a closed-loop control system. A continuous\ninterferometric measurement process is proved to einselect coherent states, and\nfeedback control is proved to be equivalent to a thermal reservoir. Ito\nequations are derived, and the P-representation is obtained from a\nFokker-Planck equation. Langevin equations are derived, and the force noise is\nshown to be the Hilbert transform of the measurement noise. The formalism is\napplied to magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) and gravity wave (GW)\ninterferometry. Some unsolved problems relating to drift and diffusion on\nHilbert spaces are noted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2004 07:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The first one serves for unambiguous discrimination of two\nnonorthogonal states of a qubit. The particular pair of states to be\ndiscriminated is specified by the quantum state of a program qubit. The second\ndevice can perform von Neumann measurements on a single qubit in any basis\nlocated on the equator of the Bloch sphere. Again, the basis is selected by the\nstate of a program qubit. In both cases the data and program qubits are\nrepresented by polarization states of photons. The experimental apparatus\nexploits the fact that two Bell states can be distinguished solely by means of\nlinear optics. The outcome corresponding to the remaining two Bell states\nrepresents an inconclusive result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2004 12:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
