An eigenvalue analysis of the\nmeasured Stokes parameters is developed to determine the origin of the excess\nPA dispersion. The analysis is applied to sensitive, well-calibrated\npolarization observations of PSR B1929+10 and PSR B2020+28.

The\nFCOS aims at investigating the nature of the Ultra Compact Dwarf galaxies\n(UCDs) recently discovered in the center of the Fornax cluster (Drinkwater et\nal. 2000). 280 unresolved objects in the magnitude space covering UCDs and\nbright globular clusters (18<V<21 mag) were observed spectroscopically. 54 new\nFornax members were discovered, plus five of the seven already known UCDs.\nTheir distribution in radial velocity, colour, magnitude and space was\ninvestigated. It is found that bright compact objects (V<20 or M_V<-11.4 mag),\nincluding the UCDs, have a higher mean velocity than faint compact objects\n(V>20 mag) at 96% confidence. The mean velocity of the bright compact objects\nis consistent with that of the dwarf galaxy population in Fornax, but\ninconsistent with that of NGC 1399's globular cluster system at 93.5%\nconfidence. The compact objects follow a colour magnitude relation with a slope\nvery similar to that of normal dEs, but shifted about 0.2 mag redwards. The\nmagnitude distribution of compact objects shows a fluent transition between\nUCDs and GCs with an overpopulation of 8 +/- 4 objects for V<20 mag with\nrespect to the extrapolation of NGC 1399's GC luminosity function. The spatial\ndistribution of bright compact objects is in comparison to the faint ones more\nextended at 88% confidence. All our findings are consistent with the threshing\nscenario (Bekki et al. 2003), suggesting that a substantial fraction of compact\nFornax members brighter than V~20 mag could be created by threshing dE,Ns.\nFainter than V~20 mag, the majority of the objects seem to be genuine GCs.

The influence of self-energy effects on the conductances is also\nconsidered using a model where the electrons interact with a dispersionless,\nlow-lying branch of bosons. We show that available tunneling spectra from\nbreak-junctions are best explained by assuming that they result from incoherent\ntunneling with a strongly anisotropic hopping matrix element of the form\nsuggested by band structure calculations.

Injected squeezed light is\ncapable of reducing the quantum noise contribution to the detector noise floor\nto values that surpass the so-called Standard-Quantum-Limit (SQL). In\nparticular, squeezed light is useful for the detection of gravitational waves\nat high frequencies where interferometers are typically shot-noise limited,\nalthough the SQL might not be beaten in this case. We theoretically analyze the\nquantum noise of the signal-recycled laser interferometric gravitational-wave\ndetector GEO600 with additional input and output optics, namely\nfrequency-dependent squeezing of the vacuum state of light entering the dark\nport and frequency-dependent homodyne detection. We focus on the frequency\nrange between 1 kHz and 10 kHz, where, although signal recycled, the detector\nis still shot-noise limited. It is found that the GEO600 detector with present\ndesign parameters will benefit from frequency dependent squeezed light.\nAssuming a squeezing strength of -6 dB in quantum noise variance, the\ninterferometer will become thermal noise limited up to 4 kHz without further\nreduction of bandwidth. At higher frequencies the linear noise spectral density\nof GEO600 will still be dominated by shot-noise and improved by a factor of\n10^{6dB/20dB}~2 according to the squeezing strength assumed. The interferometer\nmight reach a strain sensitivity of 6x10^{-23} above 1 kHz (tunable) with a\nbandwidth of around 350 Hz. We propose a scheme to implement the desired\nfrequency dependent squeezing by introducing an additional optical component to\nGEO600s signal-recycling cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2004 10:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For such boundary\nconditions classically there always exists a unique hot AdS solution and two or\nno Schwarzschild-AdS black-hole solutions depending on whether or not the\ntemperature of the cavity-wall is above a minimum value, the latter being a\nfunction of the radius of the cavity. Assuming the standard area-law of\nblack-hole entropy, it was known that larger and smaller holes have positive\nand negative specific heats and hence are locally thermodynamically stable and\nunstable respectively. In this paper we present the first derivation of this by\nshowing that the standard area law of black-hole entropy holds in the\nsemi-classical approximation of the Euclidean path integral for such boundary\nconditions. We further show that for wall-temperatures above a critical value a\nphase transition takes hot AdS to the larger Schwarzschild-AdS within the\ncavity. The larger hole thus can be globally thermodynamically stable above\nthis temperature. The phase transition can occur for a cavity of arbitrary\nradius above a (corresponding) critical temperature. In the infinite cavity\nlimit this picture reduces to that considered by Hawking and Page. The case of\nfive dimensions is found to be rather special since exact analytic expressions\ncan be obtained for the masses of the two holes as functions of cavity radius\nand temperature thus solving exactly the Euclidean Dirichlet problem. This\nmakes it possible to compute the on-shell Euclidean action as functions of them\nfrom which other quantities of interest can be evaluated exactly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2004 02:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Contrary to a widespread misconception, viewing the quantum\nformalism as being fundamentally a probability algorithm does not imply that\nquantum mechanics is concerned with states of knowledge rather than states of\nNature. On the contrary, it makes possible a complete and strongly objective\ndescription of the physical world that requires no reference to observers.

In order to demonstrate that Born's rule arises noncircularly from\ndeterministically evolving quantum states, it is not sufficient to assume that\nquantum states are somehow associated with probabilities and then prove that\nthese probabilities are given by Born's rule. One has to show how irreducible\nprobabilities can arise in the context of an ontological no-collapse\ninterpretation of quantum states.
