The natural\nendpoint of this hierarchy of methods is shown to be a fast, robust and\nstatistically efficient least-squares algorithm based on box-shaped transits.\n  This approach is predicated on the assumption of periodic transits hidden in\nrandom noise, usually assumed to be superposed on a flat continuum with regular\ncontinuous sampling.

Tidal shocks at disk crossings near perigalacticon dominate\nthe evolution of extended low-concentration clusters, resulting in massive\ntidal tails and often in a quick destruction of the cluster. The overlarge size\nof Pal5 can be explained as the result of an expansion following the heating\ninduced by the last strong disk shock ~150Myr ago. The models can reproduce the\nlow observed velocity dispersion and the relative fractions of stars in the\ntails and between the inner and outer parts of the tails. The tidal tails of\nPal5 show substantial structure not seen in our simulations. We argue that this\nstructure is probably caused by Galactic substructure, such as giant molecular\nclouds, spiral arms, and dark-matter clumps.\n  Clusters initially larger than their theoretical tidal limit remain so,\nbecause, after being shocked, they settle into a new equilibrium near\napogalacticon, where they are unaffected by the perigalactic tidal field. This\nimplies that, contrary to previous wisdom, globular clusters on eccentric\norbits may well remain super-tidally limited and hence vulnerable to strong\ndisk shocks, which dominate their evolution until destruction.

Here we present a new technique based on ideas borrowed from\nelementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is\nconceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We\nillustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 US\npresidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the\ngeographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2004 22:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

First, significant (> 0.25 nm) hydrogen Balmer_ line broadening,\nof constant width, up to 5 cm from the microwave coupler was recorded. Only\nhydrogen, and not oxygen, showed significant line broadening. This feature,\nobserved previously in hydrogen-containing mixed gas plasmas generated with\nhigh voltage dc and rf discharges was explained by some researchers to result\nfrom acceleration of hydrogen ions near the cathode. This explanation cannot\napply to the line broadening observed in the (electrodeless) microwave plasmas\ngenerated in this work, particularly at distances as great as 5 cm from the\nmicrowave coupler. Second, inversion of the line intensities of both the Lyman\nand Balmer series, again, at distances up to 5 cm from the coupler, were\nobserved. The line inversion suggests the existence of a hitherto unknown\nsource of pumping of the optical power in plasmas. Finally, it is notable that\nother aspects of the plasma including the OH* rotational temperature and low\nelectron concentrations are quite typical of plasmas of this type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2004 00:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
