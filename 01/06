Our results include cross sections, branching\nratios, and sample distributions of parameters for various outcomes. For\ninteractions of hard binaries containing main-sequence stars, we find that the\nnormalized cross section for at least one collision to occur (between any two\nof the four stars involved) is essentially unity, and that the probability of\ncollisions involving more than two stars is significant. Hydrodynamic\ncalculations have shown that the effective radius of a collision product can be\n2-30 times larger than the normal main-sequence radius for a star of the same\ntotal mass. We study the effect of this expansion, and find that it increases\nthe probability of further collisions considerably.

A particular attention was given to the case, when\nmicrolenses, - stars, star-like or planetary bodies, - are situated near the\ncritical curves of macrolenses, - galaxies, stellar clusters, etc. The\ninvestigation is of interest for the gravitational lens (GL) systems, where the\nlensed images are observed close to the critical curve of a macrolens. Annular,\narched or confluent images should be regarded as an indication to such a\nproximity. Numerical simulation allowed to determine the structure of critical\ncurves and caustics, formed by macro and microlenses, and to evaluate possible\ndistortions, caused by microlenses for various locations with respect to the\ncritical curve of a regular lens. The difference of our results from those\nobtained earlier with the standard (linearized) approach to describe the\nregular gravitational lens was shown to be the larger the closer to the\ncritical curve the microlenses are situated. In addition to spatial\nredistributions in the visible images, complicated deformation of their light\ncurves occurs in gravitational lensing of variable in time and extended\nsources. The magnitude of the temporal variations depend not only on the GL\nparameters (e.g., mass distribution), but on the parameters of the source as\nwell, such as linear dimension of the emitting region, its location with\nrespect to the critical curve, and the impulse duration.

For these bulges we have introduced the term \"Thick Boxy\nBulges\" (TBBs). About 2% of all disk galaxies (S0-Sd), respectively 4% of all\ngalaxies with box- and peanut-shaped (b/p) bulges, belong to this class of\ngalaxies.

Looking back for more than 40 years we are\nable today to see the connection between quasimolecular resonances in heavy-ion\ncollisions and extremely deformed states in light nuclei. For example\nsuperdeformed bands have been recently discovered in light N=Z nuclei such as\n$^{36}$Ar, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Cr, and $^{56}$Ni by $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy.\nThe search for strongly deformed shapes in N=Z nuclei is also the domain of\ncharged-particle spectroscopy, and our experimental group at IReS Strasbourg\nhas studied a number of these nuclei with the charged particle multidetector\narray {\\sc Icare} at the {\\sc Vivitron} Tandem facility in a systematical\nmanner. Recently the search for $\\gamma$-decays in $^{24}$Mg has been\nundertaken in a range of excitation energies where previously nuclear molecular\nresonances were found in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C collisions. The breakup reaction\n$^{24}$Mg$+^{12}$C has been investigated at E$_{lab}$($^{24}$Mg) = 130 MeV, an\nenergy which corresponds to the appropriate excitation energy in $^{24}$Mg for\nwhich the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C resonance could be related to the breakup\nresonance. Very exclusive data were collected with the Binary Reaction\nSpectrometer in coincidence with {\\sc Euroball IV} installed at the {\\sc\nVivitron}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2004 10:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that the aspect\nEinstein found objectionable - the mutual dependence of the motions of\nparticles when the (many-body) wavefunction factorises - is a generic attribute\nof his theory but that this feature may be removed by modifying Einstein's\nmethod in either of two ways: using a suggestion of Grommer or, in a physically\nimportant special case, using a simpler technique. It is emphasized though that\nthe presence or absence of the interdependence property does not determine the\nacceptability of a trajectory theory. It is shown that there are other grounds\nfor rejecting Einstein's theory (and the two modified theories), to do with its\ndomain of applicability and compatibility with empirical predictions. That\nEinstein's reason for rejection is not a priori grounds for discarding a\ntrajectory theory is demonstrated by reference to an alternative deterministic\ntrajectory theory that displays similar particle interdependence yet is\ncompatible with quantum predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2004 21:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
