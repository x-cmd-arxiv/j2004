We\ncalculate these propagation effects for cold and relativistic plasmas, and find\nthat in the presence of a uniform equipartition field the degree of linear\npolarization is suppressed, and circular polarization prevails at low\nfrequencies, nu < 1-3 GHz, (2x10^11 Hz < nu < few x 10^14 Hz) in the forward\n(reverse) shock. At higher frequencies linear polarization dominates. At the\nfrequency of the transition between circular and linear polarization, the net\nlevel of polarization is minimal, ~10-20%.

The\ndependence of these results on viewing geometry, outflow collimation and\nmagnetic field orientation is discussed. When the configuration of the field is\nentangled over length scales much smaller than the extent of the emitting\nplasma, the aforementioned effects should not be observed and a linear\npolarization at the few % level is expected.

These two well-known effects\narise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum\nfield under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity\nor dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom\ndue to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic\nfield in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall.
