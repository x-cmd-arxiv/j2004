Based on analysis of new\n(i.e., 2MASS) and old (i.e., IUE) data for about 100 sightlines, I show that\nthe UV, optical, and IR wavelength regimes do display coherent variations, but\nwith too much intrinsic scatter to be considered truly correlated. A\n1-parameter family can be constructed which illustrates these broad trends, but\nvery few individual sightlines are actually well-reproduced by such a family\nand disagreement with the mean trends is not a sufficient condition for\n``peculiarity.'' Only a very small number of extinction sightlines stand out as\ntruly peculiar. It is likely that simple variations in the mean grain size from\nsightline to sightline are responsible for much of the coherent variability\nseen in Galactic extinction, and might also explain the ``peculiar'' extinction\nlong-noted in the Magellanic Clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2004 20:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In some respects these\nuncertainties stem from the determination of whether information is inherent in\npoints of non-analyticity (discontinuities) or smoother functions. The close\nrelationship between information and entropy is also well known, e.g.\nBrillouin's concept of negentropy (negative entropy) as a measure for\ninformation. Since the leading edge of a step-discontinuity propagates in any\ndispersive medium at the speed of light in vacuum as a precursor to the main\nbody of the dispersed pulse, we propose in this paper to treat information as\nbeing intrinsic to points of non-analyticity (discontinuities). This allows us\nto construct a theory addressing these dilemmas in a fashion consistent with\ncausality, and the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. A consequence of our\nproposition is that the movement of information is always associated with the\ndissipation of heat, and therefore that the concept of reversible classical\ncomputation is not tenable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2004 17:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Evidence for a first order phase transition in equilibrium\ndomain size at vanishing noise is given by finite size scaling. A second order\nphase transition at increased cell flow is studied in a mean field\napproximation. Finally, we discuss potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2004 23:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For the particular case of a free particle moving with a fixed\nvalue of the angular momentum equal to two it is shown that Barut-Giriardello\ncoherent states are more localized at the initial time moment while the\nPerelomov coherent states are more stable with respect to time evolution.

It will be shown that Peres' statement is only valid in the large\ndistance or large time limit. In the short distance or short time limit an\nadditional deviation from perfect alignment occurs due to the uncertainty of\nthe location of the source. This error contribution plays a major role in\nPopper's orginal experimental proposal. Peres' statement applies rather to the\nphenomenon of optical imaging, which was regarded by him as a verification of\nhis statement. This is because this experiment can in a certain sense be seen\nas occurring in the large distance limit. We will also reconsider both\nexperiments from the viewpoint of Bohmian mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics\nparticles with exactly opposite momenta will move in opposite directions. In\naddition it will prove particularly usefull to use Bohmian mechanics because\nthe Bohmian trajectories coincide with the conceptual trajectories drawn by\nPittman et al. In this way Bohmian mechanics provides a theoretical basis for\nthese conceptual trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2004 15:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-03"}
