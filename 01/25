Based on\nthe proposal by Bekenstein and others that the black hole area spectrum is\ndiscrete and equally spaced, we implement Kunstatter's method to derive the\narea spectrum for the Kerr and extremal Kerr black holes. The real part of the\nquasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole used for this computation is of the\nform $m\\Omega$ where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the black hole\nhorizon. The resulting spectrum is discrete but not as expected uniformly\nspaced. Thus, we infer that the function describing the real part of\nquasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole is not the correct one. This\nconclusion is in agreement with the numerical results for the highly damped\nquasinormal modes of Kerr black hole recently presented by Berti, Cardoso and\nYoshida. On the contrary, extremal Kerr black hole is shown to have a discrete\narea spectrum which in addition is evenly spaced. The area spacing derived in\nour analysis for the extremal Kerr black hole area spectrum is not proportional\nto $\\ln 3$. Therefore, it does not give support to Hod's statement that the\narea spectrum $A_{n}=(4l^{2}_{p}ln 3)n$ should be valid for a generic\nKerr-Newman black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2004 14:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2005 16:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
