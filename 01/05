The group is dominated by an optically\nluminous giant elliptical galaxy and all other known group members are at least\ntwo magnitudes fainter. The global X-ray properties (luminosity, temperature,\nextent) of NGC 6482 fall within the range of other groups, but the detailed\nproperties show interesting differences. We derive the gas temperature and\ntotal mass profiles for the central 30 kpc using ACIS spatially resolved\nspectroscopy. The temperature profile shows a continuous decrease outward,\ndropping to 0.63 of its central value at 0.1 r_200. The derived total mass\nprofile is strongly centrally peaked, suggesting an early formation epoch.\nThese results support a picture in which fossil groups are old, giving time for\nthe most massive galaxies to have merged to produce a central giant elliptical\ngalaxy.\n  Although the cooling time within 0.1 r_200 is less than a Hubble time, no\ndecrease in central temperature is detected. The entropy of the system lies\ntoward the low side of the distribution seen in poor groups, and it drops all\nthe way into the centre of the system, reaching very low values. No isentropic\ncore, such as those predicted in simple preheating models, is present. Given\nthe lack of any central temperature drop in the system, it seems unlikely that\nradiative cooling can be invoked to explain this low central entropy. We find\nthat the centrally peaked temperature profile is consistent with a steady-state\ncooling flow solution with an accretion rate of 2 solar mass per year, given\nthe large PdV work arising from the cuspy mass profile. However, solutions\ninvolving distributed or non-steady heating cannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2004 03:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For a given angular index l the\nROBC feature integral convolution between a time-domain radiation boundary\nkernel (TDRK) and each of the corresponding 2l+1 spherical-harmonic modes of\nthe radiating wave. The TDRK is the inverse Laplace transform of a\nfrequency-domain radiation kernel (FDRK) which is essentially the logarithmic\nderivative of the asymptotically outgoing solution to the radial ODE. We\nnumerically implement the ROBC via a rapid algorithm involving approximation of\nthe FDRK by a rational function. Such an approximation is tailored to have\nrelative error \\epsilon uniformly along the axis of imaginary Laplace\nfrequency. Theoretically, \\epsilon is also a long-time bound on the relative\nconvolution error. Via study of one-dimensional radial evolutions, we\ndemonstrate that the ROBC capture the phenomena of quasinormal ringing and\ndecay tails. Moreover, carrying out a numerical experiment in which a wave\npacket strikes the boundary at an angle, we find that the ROBC yield accurate\nresults in a three-dimensional setting.
