It is shown that in a two-dimensional\nmean field model this geometry produces cyclic solutions with dynamo waves\ntraveling away from the equator -- as expected for a positive alpha effect in\nthe northern hemisphere. In three dimensions with turbulence driven by a\nhelical forcing function, an alpha effect is self-consistently generated in the\npresence of a finite imposed toroidal magnetic field. The results suggest that,\ndue to a finite flux of current helicity out of the domain, alpha quenching\nappears to be non-catastrophic -- at least for intermediate values of the\nmagnetic Reynolds number. For larger values of the magnetic Reynolds number,\nhowever, there is evidence for a reversal of the trend and that $\\alpha$ may\ndecrease with increasing magnetic Reynolds number. Control experiments with\nclosed boundaries confirm that in the absence of a current helicity flux, but\nwith shear as before, alpha quenching is always catastrophic and alpha\ndecreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. For solar\nparameters, our results suggest a current helicity flux of about 0.001 G^2/s.\nThis corresponds to a magnetic helicity flux, integrated over the northern\nhemisphere and over the 11 year solar cycle, of about 10^{46}Mx^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2004 17:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2004 07:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This amounts to precise\nways of handling the requisite additional structure encapsulating the various\ncoherence conditions. Given e. g. two augmented differential graded algebras A\nand B, an sh-map from A to B is a twisting cochain from the reduced bar\nconstruction of A to B and, in this manner, the class of morphisms of augmented\ndifferential graded algebras is extended to that of sh-morphisms. In the\npresent paper, we explore small models for equivariant (co)homology via\ndifferential homological algebra techniques including homological perturbation\ntheory which, in turn, is a standard tool to handle sh-structures.\n  Koszul duality, for a finite type exterior algebra on odd positive degree\ngenerators, then comes down to a duality between the category of sh-modules\nover that algebra and that of sh-comodules over its reduced bar construction.\nThis kind of duality relies on the extended functoriality of the differential\ngraded Tor-, Ext-, Cotor-, and Coext functors, extended to the appropriate\nsh-categories.

This\nassumption stems from the idea that the brain is made up entirely of material\nparticles and fields, and that all causal mechanisms must therefore be\nformulated solely in terms of properties of these elements. One consequence of\nthis stance is that psychological terms having intrinsic mentalistic and/or\nexperiential content (terms such as \"feeling,\" \"knowing,\" and \"effort\") have\nnot been included as primary causal factors in neuropsychological research:\ninsofar as properties are not described in material terms they are deemed\nirrelevant to the causal mechanisms underlying brain function.

It is now clear, however, that major incongruities exist and that\nthere is only a weak relationship between biological complexity and the number\nof protein coding genes. For example, using the protein-coding gene number as a\nbasis for evaluating biological complexity would make urochordates and insects\nless complex than nematodes, and humans less complex than rice. Results: We\nanalyzed the ratio of noncoding to total genomic DNA (ncDNA/tgDNA) for 85\nsequenced species and found that this ratio correlates well with increasing\nbiological complexity. The ncDNA/tgDNA ratio is generally contained within the\nbandwidth of 0.05-0.24 for prokaryotes, but rises to 0.26-0.52 in unicellular\neukaryotes, and to 0.62-0.985 for developmentally complex multicellular\norganisms.

Importantly, the\nncDNA/tgDNA ratio corrects for ploidy, and is not substantially affected by\nvariable loads of repetitive sequences. Conclusions: We suggest that the\nobserved noncoding DNA increases and compositional patterns are primarily a\nfunction of increased information content.

Numerical estimates indicate that enhanced short-range\ngravitational forces are needed for the scenario to work. The scheme fails to\nexplain quantum nonlocality, including two-detector anticorrelations, which\npoints towards the need of a nonlocal modification of the Newton-Schr\\\"odinger\ncoupling scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2004 08:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
