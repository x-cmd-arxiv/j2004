The first, and\nstrongest, suggestion of motion comes from the geometry of the HH knots in the\n\"giant\" Herbig-Haro (HH) flow associated with PV Ceph. Bisectors of lines drawn\nbetween pairs of knots at nearly equal distances from PV Ceph imply an E-W\nmotion of the source, and a plasmon model fit to the knot positions gives a\ngood fit of 22 km/s motion for the star. The second bit of damning evidence\ncomes from a redshifted \"trail\" of molecular gas, pointing in the same E-W\ndirection implied by the HH knot geometry. The third exhibit we offer in\naccusing PV Ceph of speeding involves the tilt apparent in the high-velocity\nmolecular jet now emanating from the star. This tilt is best explained if the\ntrue, current, jet direction is N-S, as it is in HST images, and the star is\nmoving at roughly 20 km/s. Tracing the motion of PV Ceph backward in time, to\nthe nearest cluster from which it might have been ejected, we find that it is\nvery likely to have been thrown out of the massive star-forming cluster NGC\n7023 (more than 10 pc away). We propose that PV Ceph was ejected, at a speed\nlarge enough to escape NGC 7023, at least 100,000 years ago, but that it did\nnot enter the molecular cloud in which it now finds itself until more like\n35,000 years ago.

In this paper we show that the group I vs. II distinction can be\nunderstood as arising from flaring vs. self-shadowed disks. We show that these\ntwo types of disks are natural solutions of the 2-D radiation-hydrostatic\nstructure equations. Disks with high optical depth turn out to be flaring and\nhave a strong far-IR emission, while disks with an optical depth below a\ncertain threshold drop into the shadow of their own puffed-up inner rim and are\nweak in the far-IR. In spite of not having a directly irradiated surface layer,\nself-shadowed disks still display dust features in emission, in agreement with\nobservations of group II sources. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which\na disk starts out with a flaring shape (group I source), and then goes through\nthe process of grain growth, causing the optical depth of the disk to drop and\nthe disk to become self-shadowed (group II source). We show that this scenario\npredicts that the (sub-)millimeter slope of the disk changes from steep (small\ngrains) to Rayleigh-Jeans-like (large grains) in the early stages of evolution,\nso that all group II sources are expected to have Rayleigh-Jeans-like slopes,\nwhile some group I sources may still have steep (sub-)millimeter slopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2004 13:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The method is applied to a SU(N) gauge theory with fermions\nup to four-loop or O(g^6) corrections. For non-equilibrium we discuss the\nconnection to kinetic theory.

It is then shown that the ghost, scalar and scalar--gauge-boson\nGreen's functions appearing in these identities capture precisely the result of\nthe pinching action at arbitrary order.

It is shown that not\nonly does a population of oppositely charged particles increase the coagulation\nrate, the inclusion of the charge-dipole interaction of the aggregates as well\nas the electric dipole potential of the dust ensemble decreases the gelation\ntime by a factor of up to twenty. It is further shown that these interactions\ncan also stimulate the onset of gelation, or \"runaway growth,\" even in a\npopulation of particles charged to a monopotential where previously it was\nbelieved that like-charged grains would inhibit coagulation. Gelation is\nobserved to occur due to the formation of high-mass aggregates with fractal\ndimensions greater than two which act as seeds for runaway growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2004 17:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
