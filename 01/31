The resulting challenges in extracting\nthis information from CMB data sets have created a new frontier. In this talk I\nwill discuss the challenges of CMB data analysis. I review what cosmological\ninformation is contained in the CMB data and the problem of extracting it. CMB\nanalyses can be divided into two types: ``canonical'' parameter extraction\nwhich seeks to obtain the best possible estimates of cosmological parameters\nwithin a pre-defined theory space and \"hypothesis testing\" which seeks to test\nthe assumption on which the canonical tests rest. Both of these activities are\nfundamentally important. In addition to mining the CMB for cosmological\ninformation cosmologists would like to strengthen the analysis with data from\nother cosmologically interesting observations as well as physical constraints.\nThis gives an opportunity 1) to test the results from these separate probes for\nconcordance and 2) if concordance is established to sharpen the constraints on\ntheory space by combining the information from these separate sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2004 18:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

It solves a long-standing problem in the field of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) data analysis but is in fact a general\ntechnique that can be applied to noisy, contaminated and incomplete or censored\nmeasurements of either spatial or temporal Gaussian random fields. In this talk\nI will phrase the method in a way that emphasizes its general structure and\napplicability but I comment on applications in the CMB context. The method\nallows the exploration of the full non-Gaussian joint posterior density of the\nsignal and parameters in the covariance matrix (such as the power spectrum)\ngiven the data. It generalizes the familiar Wiener filter in that it\nautomatically discovers signal correlations in the data as long as a noise\nmodel is specified and priors encode what is known about potential\ncontaminants. The key methodological difference is that instead of attempting\nto evaluate the likelihood (or posterior density) or its derivatives, this\nmethod generates an asymptotically exact Monte Carlo sample from it. I present\nexample applications to power spectrum estimation and signal reconstruction\nfrom measurements of the CMB. For these applications the method achieves\nspeed-ups of many orders of magnitude compared to likelihood maximization\ntechniques, while offering greater flexibility in modeling and a full\ncharacterization of the uncertainty in the estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2004 18:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

As a result, the cooling rate can be\ngreatly reduced by magnetic fields of 10^16 G for typical conditions below the\nstalled shock and a nonuniform protoneutron star magnetic field (e.g., a dipole\nfield) can introduce a large angular dependence of the cooling rate.

It is very\nabundant in heavy elements (e.g., [La/Fe]=2.2), and its relatively cool\ntemperature and low gravity mean that there are many lines of interesting\nelements present in the spectrum. We measured the abundances of 22 elements\nwith Z>29, including the rarely measured Lu and Pd. We derive an upper limit on\nthe Th abundance as well. The abundances in CS 31062-050 show a similar pattern\nto many other metal-poor CH stars: high [Pb/Fe] and [Pb/La] ratios, low [Y/La]\nratios and high [Eu/La] values compared to the solar system s-process. However,\nthe Th limit, with additional assumptions, is not consistent with the idea that\nthe excess Eu in CS 31062-050 is contributed by the r-process. In addition, the\nobserved [Eu/Tb] cannot be explained by any ratio of solar-system s-process and\nr-process abundances. We therefore argue that the abundance pattern in CS\n31062-050 is most likely the result of the s-process, and we discuss possible\nmodifications that could explain the non-solar-system pattern observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2004 23:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The nodes carry generalized charge that\nmay be randomly transferred from one node to another. Our goal is to find the\ntime evolution of the probability distribution of charges in the network. The\nbuilding blocks of our theoretical approach are (1) known probability\ndistributions for the connector currents, (2) physical constraints such as\nlocal charge conservation, and (3) a time-scale separation between the slow\ncharge dynamics of the nodes and the fast current fluctuations of the\nconnectors. We derive a stochastic path integral representation of the\nevolution operator for the slow charges.

We find a correspondence between the diffusive\nfield theory and a Langevin equation with Gaussian noise sources, leading\nnevertheless to non-trivial fluctuation statistics. To complete our theory, we\ndemonstrate that the cascade diagrammatics, recently introduced by Nagaev,\nnaturally follows from the stochastic path integral.

In\nparticular, very few systems have been discovered that may be stoichiometric\nand well ordered. To test whether U3Ni3Sn4 belongs in this latter class, we\npresent measurements of the x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) of\npolycrystalline and single-crystal U3Ni3Sn4 samples that are consistent with no\nmeasurable local structural disorder. We also present temperature-dependent\nspecific heat data in applied magnetic fields as high as 8 T that show features\nthat are inconsistent with the antiferromagnetic Griffiths' phase model, but do\nsupport the conclusion that a Fermi liquid/NFL crossover temperature increases\nwith applied field. These results are inconsistent with theoretical\nexplanations that require strong disorder effects, but do support the view that\nU3Ni3Sn4 is a stoichiometric, ordered material that exhibits NFL behavior, and\nis best described as being near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2004 01:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At the same time, we give a simple characterization of\nthe block structure condition as ``geometric regularity'' of characteristics,\ndefined as analyticity of associated eigenprojections. The totally nonglancing\nor nonglancing and linearly splitting conditions are generically satisfied in\nthe simplest case of crossings of two characteristics, and likewise for our\nmain physical examples of MHD or Maxwell equations for a crystal.

Primitive replicators generate self-similar\nstructure, but because the process happens in a piecemeal manner, through\nbottom-up interactions rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low\nfidelity, and acquired characteristics are inherited.
