The quasi-monolithic SFH produces a\npredicted CMR that agrees well at all redshifts with its observed counterpart\nonce the fixed aperture effect is removed. More importantly, we present\narguments to show that the elliptical-only CMR can be used to constrain the\nSFHs of present-day cluster ellipticals only if we believe a priori in the\nmonolithic collapse model. It is not a meaningful tool for constraining the SFH\nin the merger paradigm, because a progressively larger fraction of the\nprogenitor set of present-day cluster ellipticals is contained in late-type\nstar forming systems at higher redshift, which cannot be ignored when deriving\nthe SFHs.

In the usual procedure without spacetime translation\nmatrices, gauge terms arise from `translations' of the massless little group;\nthe little group combines spacetime rotations and boosts making a group\nisomorphic with the Euclidean group E2, including E2 translations. The usual\nremedy is to invoke gauge invariance. But here, the spacetime translation gauge\nterms can cancel the little group gauge terms, trading the need for gauge\ninvariance with the need to specify displacements and to freeze two little\ngroup degrees of freedom that are not wanted anyway. The cancelation process\nrestricts the helicity to A-B-1 for A-C = -(B-D) = 1/2 and A-B+1 for A-C =\n-(B-D) = -1/2.

A QCA system consists of a few species of\nqubits in which all qubits of a species evolve in parallel. We show that, in\nspite of its inherent constraints, a QCA system can be used to study complex\nquantum dynamics. To this aim, we demonstrate scalable operations on a QCA\nsystem that fulfill statistical criteria of randomness and explore which\ncriteria of randomness can be fulfilled by operators from various QCA\narchitectures. Other means of realizing random operators with only a few\nindependent operators are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 19:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This results in transition rates that are, for\ndistances of about one wavelength of the strong transition, up to 100% higher\nthan for independent systems. In addition the double and triple jump rates are\ncalculated from the transition rates. In this case cooperative effects of up to\n170% for distances of about one wavelength and still up to 15% around 10\nwavelengths are found.
