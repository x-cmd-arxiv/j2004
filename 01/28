The measured Doppler shifts are slightly smaller than expected,\nimplying an effective orbital radius of about 10 Rsolar, instead of 11.5 Rsolar\nfor the Algol B center of mass.

First, we demonstrate\nanalytically that, in the repulsive BEC, where the soliton is of the gap type,\nits effective mass is \\emph{negative}. This gives rise to a prediction for the\nexperiment: such a soliton cannot be not held by the usual parabolic trap, but\nit can be captured (performing harmonic oscillations) by an anti-trapping\ninverted parabolic potential. We also study the motion of the soliton a in long\nsystem, concluding that, in the cases of both the positive and negative mass,\nit moves freely, provided that its amplitude is below a certain critical value;\nabove it, the soliton's velocity decreases due to the interaction with the OL.\nAt a late stage, the damped motion becomes chaotic. We also investigate the\nevolution of a two-soliton pulse in the attractive model. The pulse generates a\npersistent breather, if its amplitude is not too large; otherwise, fusion into\na single fundamental soliton takes place. Collisions between two solitons\ncaptured in the parabolic trap or anti-trap are considered too. Depending on\ntheir amplitudes and phase difference, the solitons either perform stable\noscillations, colliding indefinitely many times, or merge into a single\nsoliton. Effects reported in this work for BECs can also be formulated for\noptical solitons in nonlinear photonic crystals. In particular, the capture of\nthe negative-mass soliton in the anti-trap implies that a bright optical\nsoliton in a self-defocusing medium with a periodic structure of the refractive\nindex may be stable in an anti-waveguide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2004 11:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Even though NM receptor regulation\nis implicated in the pharmacological action of many drugs, and is also known to\nbe influenced by various environmental factors, its functional consequences and\nmodes of action are not well understood. In this paper we summarize relevant\nexperimental evidence on NM receptor regulation (specifically dopamine D1 and\nD2 receptors) in order to explore its significance for neural and synaptic\nplasticity. We identify the relevant components of NM receptor regulation\n(receptor phosphorylation, receptor trafficking and sensitization of\nsecond-messenger pathways) gained from studies on cultured cells. Key\nprinciples in the regulation and control of short-term plasticity\n(sensitization) are identified, and a model is presented which employs direct\nand indirect feedback regulation of receptor efficacy. We also discuss\nlong-term plasticity which involves shifts in receptor sensitivity and loss of\nresponsivity to NM signals. Finally, we discuss the implications of NM receptor\nregulation for models of brain plasticity and memorization. We emphasize that a\nrealistic model of brain plasticity will have to go beyond Hebbian models of\nlong-term potentiation and depression. Plasticity in the distribution and\nefficacy of NM receptors may provide another important source of functional\nplasticity with implications for learning and memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2004 04:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The final pattern consists of a central TCR/MHCp\ndomain surrounded by a ring-shaped LFA-1/ICAM-1 domain, while the\ncharacteristic pattern formed at intermediate times is inverted with TCR/MHCp\ncomplexes at the periphery of the contact zone and LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes in\nthe center. In this article, we present a statistical-mechanical model of cell\nadhesion and propose a novel mechanism for the T cell pattern formation. Our\nmechanism for the formation of the intermediate inverted pattern is based (i)\non the initial nucleation of numerous TCR/MHCp microdomains, and (ii) on the\ndiffusion of free receptors and ligands into the contact zone. Due to this\ninward diffusion, TCR/MHCp microdomains at the rim of the contact zone grow\nfaster and form an intermediate peripheral ring for sufficiently large TCR/MHCp\nconcentrations. In agreement with experiments, we find that the formation of\nthe final pattern with a central TCR/MHCp domain requires active cytoskeletal\ntransport processes. Without active transport, the intermediate inverted\npattern seems to be metastable in our model, which might explain patterns\nobserved during natural killer (NK) cell adhesion. At smaller TCR/MHCp complex\nconcentrations, we observe a different regime of pattern formation with\nintermediate multifocal TCR/MHCp patterns which resemble experimental patterns\nfound during thymozyte adhesion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2004 15:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
