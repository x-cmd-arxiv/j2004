The radial profile of energy deposition is controlled by (a) the\npower of the jets, and (b) the pre-outburst density profile. A delay in the\nignition of the jets causes more powerful jets to impact on a more centrally\nconcentrated medium. The net effect is a sufficient increase in the central\nconcentration of energy deposition to cause the post-outburst density profile\nto be less centrally concentrated than that of an identical cluster in which\nthe outburst happened earlier and was weaker. These results suggest that the\ndensity profiles of cooling flows oscillate around an attracting profile, thus\nexplaining why cooling flows are observed to have similar density profiles.

Also the vacuum amplitude\nof the 2d gravity formulation implies important constraints on the Target space\ntheory associated with modular invariance. In this paper we study a three\ndimensional gravity approach to M-theory. We find that there are three hidden\nLiouville type fields coming from the 3d gravity sector and that these together\nwith the number of zero modes of the matter fields determine an eleven\ndimensional Target space of M theory.

Different many-body\nconfigurations are obtained by minimizing the energy under constraints on\ncollective variables like radius, dipole, quadrupole and octupole deformations.\nIn the sense of the Generator Coordinate Method we perform variation after\nprojection and multiconfiguration calculations. The same effective interaction\nderived from realistic interactions by means of the Unitary Correlation\nOperator Method is used for all nuclei. Aspects of the shell model and cluster\nnature of the ground and excited states of C12 are discussed.

Actually, such a kind of modification of special relativity has\nbeen already done. The generalized Finslerian structures of gravity-free space\nand time in the usual inertial coordinate system have been proposed.
