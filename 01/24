In particular our\nknowledge of the star formation rate which leads galaxy evolution, i.e.\nluminosity, colors and dust enrichment, is still very poor. Smoothed particle\nhydrodynamic simulations including chemo-photometric evolutionary population\nsynthesis models of isolated collapsing systems endowed with triaxial dark\nmatter halos, gas and the star formation switched on, are a useful tool to shed\nlight on several open questions. This approach, which allows a greater particle\nresolution than a fully consistent cosmological scenario, gives us important\ninsights into connections between dark and luminous matter. Both the initial\nproperties of the halo, as so as its geometry and dynamical state, and total\nmass of the system, drive the galaxy formation and evolution. In our simple\nframework spiral galaxies arise only in systems with both a total mass less\nthan 1.e12 solar masses and a critical value of the baryonic-to-total-mass\nratio, around its cosmological value, 0.1. For the same value of such a ratio\nmore massive systems host more luminous and redder galaxies, as a consequence\nof the stronger burst of star formation arising into their halos earlier on.\nMoreover the star formation does not switch on in the less massive DM halos so\nthat the critical mass to entail a luminous system is 1.e11 solar masses.

Our goal is to test the extent to which\nradiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models and/or scaled-down AGN\nmodels are consistent with the observed properties of NGC 3998. The upper-limit\nfor narrow Fe-K emission derived from a combined fit of the XMM-Newton and\nBeppoSAX spectra is 25 eV, which is one of the strictest limits to date for any\nAGN. This significantly rules out Fe-K emission as is expected to be observed\nin typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of any reflection features suggests\nthat any optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk must be truncated,\nprobably at a radius of order 100-300 R_s. RIAF models fit the UV to X-ray\nspectral energy distribution of NGC 3998 reasonably well. In these models the\nmid-IR flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component\nthat might be present. The UV to X-ray SED is also consistent with a\nComptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate, in which case the lack of\nFe-K emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk. Accretion models in\ngeneral do not account for the observed radio flux of NGC 3998, and the radio\nflux may be due to a jet.

We prove that orthotoric Kaehler manifolds are diffeomorphic to\ncomplex projective space, but we extend our analysis to orthotoric orbifolds,\nwhere the geometry is much richer.

Such a nonlinearity\nis essential to simulate robust circadian oscillations of transcription in our\nmodel and in previous models. Simulations suggest two positive feedback loops\ninvolving Clk are not essential for oscillations, because oscillations of [PER]\nwere preserved when Clk, vri, or Pdp-1 expression was fixed. Eliminating the\nnegative feedback loop in which PER represses per expression abolished\noscillations. Simulations of per or Clk null mutations and of vri, Clk, or\nPdp-1 heterozygous null mutations altered model behavior in ways similar to\nexperimental data.

Both random and\nsystematic experimental errors are found leading to a total absolute error\nequal to 8.5 pN at 95% confidence. In terms of the relative errors,\nexperimental precision of 1.75% is obtained at the shortest separation of 62 nm\nat 95% confidence level (at 60% confidence the experimental precision of 1% is\nconfirmed at the shortest separation). An independent determination of the\naccuracy of the theoretical calculations of the Casimir force and its\napplication to the experimental configuration is carefully made. Special\nattention is paid to the sample-dependent variations of the optical tabulated\ndata due to the presence of grains, contribution of surface plasmons, and\nerrors introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem. Nonmultiplicative\nand diffraction-type contributions to the surface roughness corrections are\nexamined. The electric forces due to patch potentials resulting from the\npolycrystalline nature of the gold films are estimated. The finite size and\nthermal effects are found to be negligible. The theoretical accuracy of about\n1.69% and 1.1% are found at a separation 62 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Within\nthe limits of experimental and theoretical errors very good agreement between\nexperiment and theory is confirmed characterized by the root mean square\ndeviation of about 3.5 pN within all measurement range. The conclusion is made\nthat the Casimir force is stable relative to variations of the sample-dependent\noptical and electric properties, which opens new opportunities to use the\nCasimir effect for diagnostic purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2004 13:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
