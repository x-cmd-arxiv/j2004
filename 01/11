The sample includes all Hubble types and contains SFRs\nranging from 0.01 to 100 Msun/yr. We compare the Kennicutt [OII] and H-alpha\nSFR calibrations and show that there are two significant effects which produce\ndisagreement between SFR[OII] and SFR(H-alpha): reddening and metallicity.\nDifferences in the ionization state of the ISM do not contribute significantly\nto the observed difference between SFR([OII]) and SFR(H-alpha) for the NFGS\ngalaxies with metallicities log(O/H)12>8.5. The Kennicutt [OII]-SFR relation\nassumes a typical reddening for nearby galaxies; in practice, the reddening\ndiffers significantly from sample to sample. We derive a new SFR([OII])\ncalibration which does not contain a reddening assumption. Our new SFR([OII])\ncalibration also provides an optional correction for metallicity. Our SFRs\nderived from [OII] agree with those derived from H-alpha to within 0.03-0.05\ndex. We apply our SFR([OII]) calibration with metallicity correction to two\nsamples: high-redshift 0.8<z<1.6 galaxies from the NICMOS H-alpha survey, and\n0.5<z<1.1 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey. The SFR([OII]) and\nSFR(H-alpha) for these samples agree to within the scatter observed for the\nNFGS sample, indicating that our SFR([OII]) relation can be applied to both\nlocal and high-z galaxies. Finally, we apply our SFR([OII]) to estimates of the\ncosmic star formation history. After reddening and metallicity corrections, the\nstar formation rate densities derived from [OII] and H-alpha agree to within\n30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2004 06:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A\ncommon feature of all such systems is the presence of a mesoscopic structural\nlength scale intermediate between atomic and macroscopic scales. This\nmesoscopic structure of complex fluids is often fragile and sensitive to\nexternal perturbations. Complex fluids are frequently viscoelastic (showing a\ncombination of viscous and elastic behaviour) with their dynamic response\ndepending on the time and length scales. Recently, non-invasive methods to\ninfer the rheological response of complex fluids have gained popularity through\nthe technique of microrheology, where the diffusion of probe spheres in a\nviscoelastic fluid is monitored with the aid of light scattering or microscopy.\nHere we propose an alternative to traditional microrheology that does not\nrequire doping of probe particles in the fluid (which can sometimes drastically\nalter the molecular environment).

The contact order controlls folding scenarios: the average\ntimes necessary to bring pairs of amino acids into their near native\nseparations depend on the sequential distances within the pairs. This\ndependence is largely monotonic, regardless of the cooperativity, and the\ndominant trend could be described by a single parameter like the average\ncontact order.
