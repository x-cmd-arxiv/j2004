The metallicity and\nrelative abundance of `$\\alpha$-elements' show strong correlations with galaxy\nage and central velocity dispersion, with similar trends found in all\nenvironments.

This correlation is thus found to be an artifact of incomplete\ncalibration to the Lick system.\n  Variations are seen in the ranges and average values of age, metallicity and\n$\\alpha$-element abundance ratios for galaxies in different environments. Age\ndistributions support the hierarchical formation prediction that field galaxies\nare on average younger than their cluster counterparts. However, the ages of\nHCG galaxies are shown to be more similar to those of cluster galaxies than\nthose in the field, contrary to the expectations of current hierarchical\nmodels.

The Earth is believed to\ncapture WIMPs not dominantly from the Milky Way halo directly, but instead from\na distribution of WIMPs that have diffused around in the solar system due to\ngravitational interactions with the planets in the solar system. Recently,\ndoubts have been raised about the lifetime of these WIMP orbits due to solar\ncapture. We here investigate this issue by detailed numerical simulations.\n  Compared to earlier estimates, we find that the WIMP velocity distribution is\nsignificantly suppressed below about 70 km/s which results in a suppression of\nthe capture rates mainly for heavier WIMPs (above ~100 GeV). At 1 TeV and above\nthe reduction is almost a factor of 10.\n  We apply these results to the case where the WIMP is a supersymmetric\nneutralino and find that, within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM), the annihilation rates, and thus the neutrino fluxes, are reduced even\nmore than the capture rates. At high masses (above ~1 TeV), the suppression is\nalmost two orders of magnitude.\n  This suppression will make the detection of neutrinos from heavy WIMP\nannihilations in the Earth much harder compared to earlier estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 15:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Starting from a well-defined model Hamiltonian, which includes the\neffects of driving current and dissipative coupling to a heat bath, we write\ndown the Heisenberg equations of motion for the variables of the Josephson\njunction and the cavity mode. In the limit of many photons, these equations\nreduce to coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved\nnumerically. We present a review of some characteristic numerical results,\nwhich show many features similar to experiment. These include self-induced\nresonant steps (SIRS's) at voltages $V = n\\hbar\\Omega/(2e)$, where $\\Omega$ is\nthe cavity frequency, and $n$ is generally an integer; a threshold number $N_c$\nof active rows of junctions above which the array is coherent; and a\ntime-averaged cavity energy which is quadratic in the number of active\njunctions, when the array is above threshold. When the array is biased on a\nSIRS, then, for given junction parameters, the power radiated into the array\nvaries as the square of the number of active junctions, consistent with\nexpectations for coherent radiation. For a given step, a two-dimensional array\nradiates much more energy into the cavity than does a one-dimensional array.\nFinally, in two dimensions, we find a strong polarization effect: if the cavity\nmode is polarized perpendicular to the direction of current injection in a\nsquare array, then it does not couple to the array and no power is radiated\ninto the cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 01:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The model\nproblem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate,\nblocking electrodes which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the\nelectrodes are also taken into account.

The regular solutions with finite centre and non-zero surface\ndensities which do not fulfill the criterion [20], in fact, can not meet the\nrequirement of the `actual mass' set up by exterior Schwarzschild solution. The\nonly regular solution which could be possible in this regard is represented by\nuniform (homogeneous) density distribution.\n  The criterion [20] provides a necessary and sufficient condition for any\nstatic and spherical configuration (including core-envelope models) to be\ncompatible with the structure of general relativity. Thus, it may find\napplication to construct the appropriate core-envelope models of stellar\nobjects like neutron stars and may be used to test various equations of state\nfor dense nuclear matter and the models of relativistic stellar structures like\nstar clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 07:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this scenario\nthe acceleration of the universe is related not only to the variation of the\ncosmological term, but also to the time evolution of $G$ and, possibly, to the\nvariation of other fundamental \"constants\" as well. This is because the\nexpansion rate of the extra dimension appears in different contexts, notably in\nexpressions concerning the variation of rest mass and electric charge. We\nconcentrate our attention on spatially-flat, homogeneous and isotropic,\nbrane-universes where the matter density decreases as an inverse power of the\nscale factor, similar (but at different rate) to the power law in FRW-universes\nof general relativity.\n  We show that these braneworld cosmologies are consistent with the observed\naccelerating universe and other observational requirements.

The following\nchapter explains the foundations of orientifolds. Chapters 4-7 present own\nresearch. In chapter 4 we quantize open strings with linear boundary\nconditions, as they show up in electro-magnetic fields. We quantize the\nzero-modes for toroidal compactifications, too. As an application we calculate\nthe commutator of the coordinate fields in the case of general constant\nNeveu-Schwarz U(1)-field strengths. Thereby we confirm previous results on\nnon-commutativity of open string theories in Neveu-Schwarz backgrounds. Chapter\n5 reviews the results of a former publication [1] on asymmetric orientifolds,\nsupplemented by some recent insights in connection with chapter 4. Chapter 6\nsummarizes publication [2] where we investigated to what extend one can build\nphenomenologically interesting models from toroidal orientifolds. By turning on\nmagnetic fluxes on D9-branes we induce chiral fermions. Most calculations are\nperformed in an (equivalent) T-dual picture. Here the number of chiral fermions\nis given by the topological intersection number of D-branes. In orientifolds of\ntoroidal compactifications one obtains either non-chiral or non-supersymmetric\norientifold solutions. However both properties can be reconciled in\norientifolds that are obtained from specific supersymmetric orbifold\ncompactifications. In chapter 7 we present the ``sigma Omega'' -Orientifold on\na T^6/Z(4) orbifold.

A number of trends and\npossibilities for future applications in these fields with improved\nperformance, less material, high read-out speed, large radiation tolerance, and\npotential off-the-shelf availability have appeared and are momentarily matured.\nAmong them are monolithic or semi-monolithic approaches which do not require\ncomplicated hybridization but come as single sensor/IC entities. Most of these\nare presently still in the development phase waiting to be used as detectors in\nexperiments. The present state in pixel detector development including hybrid\nand (semi-)monolithic pixel techniques and their suitability for particle\ndetection and for imaging, is reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2004 14:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-22"}

Quantum revivals are characterized by\ninitially localized quantum states which have a short-term, quasi-classical\ntime evolution, which then can spread significantly over several orbits, only\nto reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading\nreverses itself, the wave packet relocalizes, and the semi-classical\nperiodicity is once again evident. Relocalization of the initial wave packet\ninto a number of smaller copies of the initial packet (`minipackets' or\n`clones') is also possible, giving rise to fractional revivals. Systems\nexhibiting such behavior are a fundamental realization of time-dependent\ninterference phenomena for bound states with quantized energies in quantum\nmechanics and are therefore of wide interest in the physics and chemistry\ncommunities.\n  We review the theoretical machinery of quantum wave packet construction\nleading to the existence of revivals and fractional revivals, in systems with\none (or more) quantum number(s), as well as discussing how information on the\nclassical period and revival time is encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum.\nWe discuss a number of one-dimensional model systems which exhibit revival\nbehavior, including the infinite well, the quantum bouncer, and others, as well\nas several two-dimensional integrable quantum billiard systems. Finally, we\nbriefly review the experimental evidence for wave packet revivals in atomic,\nmolecular, and other systems, and related revival phenomena in condensed matter\nand optical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2004 19:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
