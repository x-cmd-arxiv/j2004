By introducing a canonical ensemble we calculate the canonical\npartition function of this model exactly. Using the Yang-Lee theory of phase\ntransitions we spot a second-order phase transition from a power-law to a\njammed phase. The density profile of particles in each phase has also been\nstudied. A simple generalization of this model in which both the left and the\nright boundaries are open has also been introduced. It is shown that double\nshock structures may evolve in the system under certain conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2004 08:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

But two\nmajor challenges must be overcome to achieve this goal: obtaining average ion\nenergies well above 100keV and minimizing losses by bremsstrahlung x-rays.\nRecent experimental and theoretical work indicates that these challenges may be\novercome with the dense plasma focus. DPF experiments at Texas A&M University\nhave demonstrated ion and electron average energies above 100keV in\nseveral-micron-sized hot-spots or plasmoids. These had\ndensity-confinement-time-energy products as high as 5.0 x10^15 keVsec/cm^3. In\nthese experiments we clearly distinguished between x-rays coming from the\nhot-spots and the harder radiation coming from electron beam collisions with\nthe anode. In addition, new theoretical work shows that extremely high magnetic\nfields, which appear achievable in DPF plasmoids, will strongly reduce\ncollisional energy transfer from ions to electrons. This reduction has been\nstudied in the context of neutron stars and occurs when ion velocities are too\nsmall to efficiently excite electron transitions between Landau levels. It\nbecomes a major effect for fields above 5 gigagauss. This effect will allow\naverage electron energies to stay far below average ion energies and will thus\nreduce x-ray cooling of p11B. In this case, fusion power will very\nsignificantly exceed x-ray emitted power. While fields of only 0.4 gigagauss\nhave so far been demonstrated with the DPF, scaling laws indicate that much\nhigher fields can be reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2004 20:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2004 01:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Wigner\nfunctions have also been developed for discrete quantum systems, one popular\nversion being defined on a 2N x 2N discrete phase space for a system with N\northogonal states. Here we investigate an alternative class of discrete Wigner\nfunctions, in which the field of real numbers that labels the axes of\ncontinuous phase space is replaced by a finite field having N elements. There\nexists such a field if and only if N is a power of a prime; so our formulation\ncan be applied directly only to systems for which the state-space dimension\ntakes such a value. Though this condition may seem limiting, we note that any\nquantum computer based on qubits meets the condition and can thus be\naccommodated within our scheme. The geometry of our N x N phase space also\nleads naturally to a method of constructing a complete set of N+1 mutually\nunbiased bases for the state space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2004 20:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2004 17:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2004 03:58:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 May 2004 17:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2004 18:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2005 20:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
