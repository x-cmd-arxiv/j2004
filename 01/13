A big contribution from the Galactic synchrotron emission to the\nTE power spectrum on large angular scales is indeed expected, in the lower\nfrequency WMAP channels, based on current, albeit very uncertain, models; at\nhigher frequencies the rapid decrease of the synchrotron signal may be, to some\nextent, compensated by polarized dust emission. Recent measurements of\npolarization properties of extragalactic radio sources at high radio frequency\nindicate that their contamination of the CMB polarization on degree scales at\n30 GHz is substantially below the expected CMB E-mode amplitude. Adding the\nsynchrotron contribution, we estimate that the overall foreground contamination\nof the signal detected by DASI may be significant but not dominant. The excess\npower on arc-min scales detected by the BIMA experiment may be due to\ngalactic-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, if the proto-galactic gas is heated\nto its virial temperature and its cooling time is comparable to the Hubble time\nat the epoch of galaxy formation. A substantial contamination by radio sources\nof the signal reported by the CBI group on scales somewhat larger than BIMA's\ncannot be easily ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2004 16:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
