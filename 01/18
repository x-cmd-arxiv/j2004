But the characteristic features in the SNIa gamma ray spectrum,\nweakened by integration over source redshifts, are hard to measure, and\nadditionally the contributions from other sources in the MeV range are\nuncertain, so that the SNIa origin of the MeV CGB remains unproven. Since\ndifferent CGB sources have different clustering properties and redshift\ndistributions, by combining the CGB spectrum and angular correlation\nmeasurements, the contributions to the CGB could be identified and separated.\nThe SNIa CGB large-scale structure follows that of galaxies. Its rms\nfluctuation at degree scales has a characteristic energy dependence, ranging\nfrom $\\sim 1%$ to order of unity and can be measured to several percent\nprecision by proposed future satellites such as the Advanced Compton Telescope.\nWith the identification of the SNIa contribution, the SNIa rate could be\nmeasured unambiguously as a function of redshift up to $z \\sim 1$, by combining\nboth the spectrum and angular correlation measurements, yielding new\nconstraints on the star formation rate to even higher redshifts.
