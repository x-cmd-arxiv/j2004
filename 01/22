First, the model continues to depend wholly on two pieces\nof undiscovered physics, namely dark energy and cold dark matter. Then, the\nimplied dark energy density is so small that it is unstable to quantum\ncorrection and its size is fine-tuned to the almost impossible level of one\npart in ~10^102; it is also difficult to explain the coincidence between the\ndark energy, dark matter and baryon densities at the present day. Moreover, any\nmodel with a positive cosmological constant also creates fundamental\ndifficulties for superstring theories of quantum gravity. We also review the\nsignificant number of astrophysical observations which are now in contradiction\nwith the LCDM model. On the grounds that the SNIa Hubble diagram is prone to\nevolutionary corrections and also that the CMB power spectrum may be\ncontaminated by the effects of foreground ionised gas, we argue that the\nexistence of such systematics could still allow more satisfactory, alternative,\nmodels to appear. We suggest that if H_0<50kms^-1Mpc^-1 then a simpler,\ninflationary model with Omega_baryon=1 might still be allowed with no need for\ndark energy or cold dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2004 18:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In this paper, we investigate the nature of the IR emission in\nthe context of models recently proposed to interpret the X-ray flares. We show\nthat the IR emission in Sgr A* can be well explained by nonthermal synchrotron\nemission if a small fraction of the electrons in the innermost region of the\naccretion flow around the black hole are accelerated {into a broken power-law\ndistribution}, perhaps due to transient events such as magnetic reconnection.\nThe model predicts differences in the variability amplitudes of flares in the\nIR and X-rays, in general agreement with observations. It also predicts that\nthe IR emission should be linearly polarized, as has indeed been observed\nduring one epoch. IR and X-ray flares analogous to those observed in Sgr A* may\nbe detectable from other accreting SMBHs, provided $L \\lsim 10^{-8} L_{EDD}$;\nat higher luminosities the flaring emission is dominated by thermal\nsynchrotron-self Compton emission, which is likely to be less variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2004 19:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this study, we introduce a new formalism to model conduction in a\ndiffuse ionised plasma using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and we\nimplement it in the parallel TreePM/SPH-code GADGET-2. We consider only\nisotropic conduction and assume that magnetic suppression can be described in\nterms of an effective conductivity, taken as a fixed fraction of the\ntemperature-dependent Spitzer rate. We also account for saturation effects in\nlow-density gas. Our formulation manifestly conserves thermal energy even for\nindividual and adaptive timesteps, and is stable in the presence of small-scale\ntemperature noise. This allows us to evolve the thermal diffusion equation with\nan explicit time integration scheme along with the ordinary hydrodynamics. We\nuse a series of simple test problems to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy\nof our method. We then apply our code to spherically symmetric realizations of\nclusters, constructed under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and a\nlocal balance between conduction and radiative cooling. While we confirm that\nconduction can efficiently suppress cooling flows for an extended period of\ntime in these isolated systems, we do not find a similarly strong effect in a\nfirst set of clusters formed in self-consistent cosmological simulations.\nHowever, their temperature profiles are significantly altered by conduction, as\nis the X-ray luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2004 14:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2004 13:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 12:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Among the new timing phenomena revealed by RXTE the burst\noscillations are perhaps the best understood, in the sense that many of their\nproperties can be explained in the framework of this relatively simple model.\nBecause of this, detailed modelling of burst oscillations can be an extremely\npowerful probe of neutron star structure, and thus the equation of state (EOS)\nof supra-nuclear density matter.

The initial energy density is well\nabove the one considered necessary for the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma,\nQGP. The production of charged particles of various masses is consistent with\nchemical and thermal equilibrium. Recently, a suppression of the high\ntransverse momentum component of hadron spectra has been observed in central\nAu+Au collisions. This can be explained by the energy loss experienced by\nleading partons in a medium with a high density of unscreened color charges. In\ncontrast, such high $p_t$ jets are not suppressed in d+Au collisions suggesting\nthat the high $p_t$ suppression is not due to initial state effects in the\nultrarelativistic colliding nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2004 22:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We illustrate the resolution of this thermodynamical puzzle in the\ncontext of the surface impedance approach by several calculations of the\nthermal Casimir force and entropy for both real metals and dielectrics.\nDifferent representations for the impedances, which are equivalent for real\nphotons, are discussed. Finally, we argue in favor of the Leontovich boundary\ncondition which leads to results for the thermal Casimir force that are\nconsistent with thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2004 09:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
