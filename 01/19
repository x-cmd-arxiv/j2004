We show\nthat modeling knots of the these objects as stationary regions of energy\ndissipation within the uniform and continuous jet flow leads to several\nproblems. Such problems are especially pronounced if the observed X-ray\nemission is due to inverse-Compton scattering of the CMB radiation. We explore\nanother possibility, namely that the knots represent moving and separate\nportions of the jet matter, with excess kinetic power. We suggest a possible\nconnection between this scenario and the idea of intermittent/highly modulated\njet activity. The proposed model can explain some morphological properties of\nquasar jets -- like high knot-to-interknot brightness contrasts,\nfrequency-independent knot profiles and almost universal extents of the knot\nregions -- independently of the exact emission mechanism responsible for\nproducing the X-rays. In this context, we consider different possibilities for\nthe production of such X-ray radiation, and discuss the related issue of\nparticle acceleration. We conclude that the appropriate process cannot be\ndesignated for certain yet. We suggest, however, that X-ray observations of the\njet in 3C 120 (in which intermittent jet activity is quite distinct) already\nseem to support the synchrotron origin of the X-ray emission, at least in this\nobject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2004 17:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2004 11:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\ndiscuss the seeming inconsistency of relativistic light deflection with the\nclassical picture of moving test particles by generalizing the lens effect to\ntest particles of arbitrary velocity, including light as a limiting case. We\nshow that the effect of radial motion of the lens is very different for slowly\nmoving test particles and light and that a critical test particle velocity\nexists for which the motion of the lens has no effect on the deflection angle\nto first order. An interesting and not immediately intuitive result is obtained\nin the limit of a highly relativistic motion of the lens towards the observer,\nwhere the deflection angle of light reduces to zero.

Furthermore, we discuss the\ndragging of inertial frames in the field of a moving lens and the corresponding\nLense-Thirring precession, in order to shed more light on the geometrical\neffects in the surroundings of a moving mass. In a second part we discuss the\neffect of transversal motion on the observed redshift of lensed sources. We\ndemonstrate how a simple kinematic calculation explains the effects for\narbitrary velocities of the lens and test particles.
