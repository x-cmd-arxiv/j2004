In this paper, we investigate whether heating by a\ncentral AGN can explain the distribution of excess entropy as a function of\nradius. The AGN is assumed to inject buoyant bubbles into the ICM, which heat\nthe ambient medium by doing pdV work as they rise and expand. Several authors\nhave suggested that this \"effervescent heating\" mechanism could allow the\ncentral regions of clusters to avoid the ``cooling catastrophe''. Here we study\nthe effect of effervescent heating at large radii. Our calculations show that\nsuch a heating mechanism is able to solve the entropy problem. The only free\nparameters of the model are the time-averaged luminosity and the AGN lifetime.\nThe results are mainly sensitive to the total energy injected into the cluster.\nOur model predicts that the total energy injected by AGN should be roughly\nproportional to the cluster mass.

The word ``collisionless'' indicates that the particles are\nso weakly interacting that they move purely under the influence of gravity.\nGalaxies are surrounded by CDM and hence, because of gravity, CDM keeps falling\nonto galaxies from all directions. CDM infall produces a discrete number of\nflows and caustics in the halos of galaxies. There are two types of caustics in\nthe halos of galaxies: inner and outer. An outer caustic is a simple fold\ncatastrophe located on a topological sphere enveloping the galaxy. An inner\ncaustic is a closed tube whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic\ncatastrophe, with three cusps. In space, caustics are the boundaries that\nseparate regions with differing numbers of flows. One side of a caustic surface\nhas two more flows than the other.

The observational data consists\nof medium resolution spectra, obtained at the Very Large Telescope. Our sample\ncomprises 468 radial velocities in the magnitude range 20 < m_R < 23. This is\nthe largest sample of globular cluster velocities around any galaxy obtained so\nfar. The radial range is 2 arcmin < r < 9 arcmin, corresponding to 11 kpc to 50\nkpc of galactocentric distance. There is the possibility that unbound clusters\nand/or objects in the foreground contaminate the NGC 1399 cluster sample. Under\nstrong error selection, practically no objects are found with velocities lower\nthan 800 km/s or higher than 2000 km/s. Since the extreme velocities influence\nthe velocity dispersion considerably, uncertainty regarding the exact value of\nthe dispersion remains. Within the above velocity limits, we derive a projected\nvelocity dispersion for the total sample of 274+-9 km/s which within the\nuncertainties remains constant over the entire radial range. Without any\nvelocity restriction, it increases to 325 km/s. Blue and red clusters show\ndifferent dispersions corresponding to their different surface density\nprofiles. Spherical models point to a circular velocity of 415+-30$ km/s,\nassuming isotropy for the red clusters. This value is constant out to 40 kpc.\nThe inferred dark halo potential can be well represented by a logarithmic\npotential. Also a halo of the NFW type fits well to the observations. Some mass\nprofiles derived from X-ray analyses do not agree with a constant circular\nvelocity within our radial range, irrespective of its exact value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2004 14:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The effect occurs in\nlow-dimensional magnetically ordered materials when a small gap, \\delta, in the\nacoustic magnon (spin wave) spectra is closed using a magnetic field H >\n\\delta/g\\mu_B. Since all magnetically ordered materials must have a gap in the\nmagnon spectra for magnons with k = 0, this may be a very general effect.

A wide\nvariety of quantum phenomena are found to have analogues within this toy\ntheory. Such phenomena include: the noncommutativity of measurements,\ninterference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the\nimpossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a\nuniversal state inverter, the distinction between bi-partite and tri-partite\nentanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting,\nremote steering, teleportation, dense coding, mutually unbiased bases, and many\nothers. The diversity and quality of these analogies is taken as evidence for\nthe view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than\nstates of reality. A consideration of the phenomena that the toy theory fails\nto reproduce, notably, violations of Bell inequalities and the existence of a\nKochen-Specker theorem, provides clues for how to proceed with this research\nprogram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2004 20:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2005 18:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We compare the performance of walk based classical\nand quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general.\nLet $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i\n,j\\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that\nthe set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\\epsilon n$. The\ngoal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds.\nOur model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can\ngenerate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically,\nby request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for\nthe cost of $\\wp_{0}$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element $i$ into the black\nbox we can obtain a random element $j$, where $j$ is distributed according to\n$P[i,j]$. The cost of the latter operation is $\\wp_{1}$. Finally, we can use\nthe black box to test if an element $i$ is marked, and this costs us $\\wp_{2}$.\nIf $\\delta$ is the eigenvalue gap of $P$, there is a simple classical algorithm\nwith cost $O(\\wp_{0} + (\\wp_{1}+\\wp_{2})/\\delta\\epsilon)$ that solves the above\npromise problem. (The algorithm is efficient if $\\wp_{0}$ is much larger than\n$\\wp_{1}+\\wp_{2}$.) In contrast,we show that for the ``quantized'' version of\nthe algorithm it costs only $O(\\wp_{0} +\n(\\wp_{1}+\\wp_{2})/\\sqrt{\\delta\\epsilon})$ to solve the problem. We refer to\nthis as the $\\sqrt{\\delta\\epsilon}$ rule. Among the technical contributions we\ngive a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2004 00:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
