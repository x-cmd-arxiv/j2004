For the smaller\nsupershells, our results are consistent with the few detected pulsars per\nbubble. For the giant supershell GSH 242-03+37, we find the multiple SN\nhypothesis inconsistent with current data at the 95% level. We stress the\nimportance of undertaking deep pulsar surveys in correlation with supershells.\nFailure to detect any pulsar enhancement in the largest of them would put\nserious constraints on the multiple SN origin for them. Conversely, the\ndiscovery of the pulsar population associated with a supershell would allow a\ndifferent/independent approach to the study of pulsar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2004 21:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The anticorrelation\nbetween the observed flux and the polarization degree (observed in the optical\nband also for B0656+14) naturally results from the caustic nature of the peaks\nwhich are produced in the model due to the superposition of radiation from many\ndifferent altitudes, ie. polarized at different angles.

We first interpret\nprevious rigorous works in a unifying framework based on the statistical\nphysics notions of dynamical trajectories, phase diagram and growth process. It\nis argued that, under the action of the Davis--Putnam--Loveland--Logemann\n(DPLL) algorithm, 3-SAT instances are turned into 2+p-SAT instances whose\ncharacteristic parameters (ratio alpha of clauses per variable, fraction p of\n3-clauses) can be followed during the operation, and define resolution\ntrajectories. Depending on the location of trajectories in the phase diagram of\nthe 2+p-SAT model, easy (polynomial) or hard (exponential) resolutions are\ngenerated. Three regimes are identified, depending on the ratio alpha of the\n3-SAT instance to be solved. Lower sat phase: for small ratios, DPLL almost\nsurely finds a solution in a time growing linearly with the number N of\nvariables. Upper sat phase: for intermediate ratios, instances are almost\nsurely satisfiable but finding a solution requires exponential time (2 ^ (N\nomega) with omega>0) with high probability. Unsat phase: for large ratios,\nthere is almost always no solution and proofs of refutation are exponential. An\nanalysis of the growth of the search tree in both upper sat and unsat regimes\nis presented, and allows us to estimate omega as a function of alpha. This\nanalysis is based on an exact relationship between the average size of the\nsearch tree and the powers of the evolution operator encoding the elementary\nsteps of the search heuristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2004 12:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-20"}

First of all a complete unified picture of\n$n$-dimensional quantum gravity is proposed in the following sense: In spin\nfoam models of quantum gravity the evaluation of spin networks play a very\nimportant role. These evaluations correspond to amplitudes which contribute in\na state sum model of quantum gravity. In \\cite{fk}, the evaluation of spin\nnetworks as integrals over internal spaces was described. This evaluation was\nrestricted to evaluations of spin networks in $n$-dimensional Euclidean quantum\ngravity. Here we propose that a similar method can be considered to include\nLorentzian quantum gravity. We therefore describe the the evaluation of spin\nnetworks in the Lorentzian framework of spin foam models. We also include a\nlimit of the Euclidean and Lorentzian spin foam models which we call Newtonian.\nThis Newtonian limit was also considered in \\cite{jm}.\n  Secondly, we propose an alternative formulation of spin foam models of\nquantum gravity with its corresponding evaluation of spin networks. This\nalternative formulation is a non-archimedean or $p$-adic spin foam model. The\ninterest on this description is that it is based on a discrete space-time,\nwhich is the expected situation we might have at the Planck length; this\ndescription might lead us to an alternative regularisation of quantum gravity.\nMoreover a non-commutative formulation follows from the non-archimedean one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2004 20:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmain reason of such attribute of all detectors used in electron epectrometry is\nthe energy of several hundreds KeV taken by the backscattered electrons. A\nsimple method of rejecting the events when the electrons are backscattered -\nthe use of a second -\"veto\" - detector in anticoincidences with the main\ndetector was investigated. The low amplitude \"tail\" in the response curve could\nbe reduced by a factor of 3 - 4 . The remaining effect - about 1% of the\nintegral has yet no explanation. Additional experiments showed that only\n\\~0.2-0.3% can be related to bremmsstrahlung. The significance of this effect\nin the study of angular correlations in neutron beta decay was analyzed too\nwith the help of a simplified computer model. As a result, we propose a method\nof calculating appropriate corrections which promise to reduce the systematic\nuncertainty in the measurement of the \"a\" correlation coefficient which going\nto be carried out in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2004 20:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The model contains a spin independent three-quark interaction which is\ninspired by Lattice QCD calculations and reproduces the average energy values\nof the SU(6) multiplets. The splittings are obtained with a SU(6)-breaking\ninteraction, which can include also an isospin dependent term. Concerning\nConstituent Quark models, we have shown for the first time that the decreasing\nof the ratio of the elastic form factors of the proton is due to relativistic\neffects using relativistic corrections to the e.m. current and boosts. Now the\nelastic nucleon form factors have been recalculated, using a relativistic\nversion of the hCQM and a relativistic quark current showing a very detailed\nreproduction of all the four form factor existing data over the complete range\nof 0-4 $GeV^2$. Futhermore, the model has been used for predictions concerning\nthe electromagnetic transverse and longitudinal transition form factors giving\na good description of the medium $Q^2$ behaviour. We show that the\ndiscrepancies in the reproduction of the helicity amplitudes at low $Q^2$ are\ndue to pion loops. We have calculated the helicity amplitudes for all the 3 and\n4 star resonances opening the possibility of application to the evaluation of\ncross sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2004 10:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2004 14:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

These models are finite\ndifferencing in the time domain and digital waveguide models. It is known from\nthe theory of partial differential operators that in general one has to expect\nthe string to accumulate displacement as response to impulsive excitations.\nDiscrete models should be expected to display comparable behavior. As a result\nit is shown that impulsive propagations can be interpreted as the difference of\nstep functions and hence how the impulsive response can be seen as one case of\nthe general integrating behavior of the string. Impulsive propagations come\nabout in situations of time-symmetry whereas step-function occur as a result of\ntime-asymmetry. The difference between the physical stability of the wave\nequation, which allows for unbounded growth in displacement, and computational\nstability, that requires bounded growth, is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2004 16:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
