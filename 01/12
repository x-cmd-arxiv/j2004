The only open $\\Theta^+$ decay\nchannel is $KN$. When two states both coupled to a single dominant decay mode\nare mixed by the loop diagram via this decay mode, diagonalization of the loop\ndiagram decouples one mass eigenstate from this decay mode as in some\ntreatments of the $\\rho-\\pi$ decay from the mixed singlet-octet $\\omega-\\phi$\nsystem, the $K^* -\\pi$ decay of the strange axial vector mesons and the $NK$\ncouplings of some baryons. This mechanism can explain the narrow width and weak\ncoupling of $\\Theta^+ \\to KN$ while allowing a relatively large production\ncross section from $K^*$ exchange. Interesting tests are suggested in $K^-p$\nreactions where backward kaon production must go by exotic baryon exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2004 23:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2004 21:31:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2004 17:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The first part of this work is trying to give\na definition for final states of 2D decaying turbulence. Although the\nfunctional relation of $\\omega-\\psi$ is frequently used as the characterization\nof those \"final states,\" it is just a sufficient but not necessary condition so\nit is not proper to be used as the definition. It is found the way through the\nvalue of the effective area S covered by the scatter $\\omega-\\psi$ plot, which\nis initially suggested by Read, is more general, and more suitable for the\ndefinition. Based on this concept, we gave out a definition that can cover all\nexisting results in late states of decaying 2D flows, including some weird\ndouble-valued $\\omega-\\psi$ scatter plots that can not be explained before. The\nrest part of the paper is trying to further investigate 2D decaying turbulence\nwith the assistance of our new definition. Some new numerical results, which\nlead to \"bar\" final states and further verify the predictive ability of\nstatistical mechanics [2], are reported.
