The\nneedles consist of metallic whiskers with <1% of embedded impurities that may\nhave condensed out of blobs of material that were expelled at high velocities\nfrom the inner metal-rich layers of the star in an asymmetric explosion. The\nneedles are collisionally heated by the shocked gas to a temperature of 8K.\nTaking the destruction of needles into account, a dust mass of only 1E-4 to\n1E-3M_sun is needed to account for the observed SCUBA emission. Aligned in the\nmagnetic field, needles may give rise to observable polarized emission.

Perturbations created by such waves\ncolliding with vortices are studied in the context of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nmodel. We find that the effect of the interactions consists of two competing\nmechanisms: the creation of vortex line as rarefaction waves acquire\ncirculation in a vicinity of a vortex core and the loss of the vortex line to\nsound due to Kelvin waves that are generated on vortex lines by rarefaction\npulses. When a vortex ring collides with a rarefaction wave, the ring either\nstabilises to a smaller ring after emitting sound through Kelvin wave radiation\nor the entire energy of the vortex ring is lost to sound if the radius of the\nring is of the order of the healing length.

The microscopic models give results which are\ncontrary to recently published pi+pi- balance functions from the STAR\ncollaboration, whereas the thermal model roughly reproduce the experimental\nresults. This suggests that charge conservation is local at breakup, which is\nin line with expectations for a delayed hadronization. Predictions are also\npresented for balance functions binned as a function of Q_inv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2004 22:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A connection between optimal states obtained from the principle of\nminimum distance in the space of quantum states and the most stringent (MaxEnt)\nentropic bounds on Tsallis-like entropies for quantum scattering, is\nestablished.
