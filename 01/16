This transition is actually a direct consequence of the web's small world\narchitecture exploited by the routing algorithm. Once routing tables reach the\nnetwork diameter, the traffic experiences a sudden transition from a\nlow-efficient to a highly-efficient behavior.

One of the main reasons for that is that quantized general\nrelativity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable. But there are several theories\nwhose low-energy effective action is general relativity such as super string\ntheory, supergravity and so on. On the other hand there is the prospect that\nquantized general relativity will become consistent nonperturbatively, for\nexample by way of the $\\epsilon$ - expanded analysis in 2 + $\\epsilon$ gravity\nand the implication of the exact renormalization group equation (ERGE) and so\non. Thus, the reason that we can't check which is right, is because of no\nconstraint from experiments. By the way, the early Universe can be considered a\ngood laboratory for QG, because of the high energy scale. In this period it is\nthought that the effect of QG governed the Universe. Therefore to construct the\nUniverse model out of consideration of a certain type of QG can be thought of\nthe test of the theory. Here the result of quantized general relativity, which\nis treated nonperturbatively by ERGE, is checked. The application of QG\nimproved Einstein equation to the very early Universe shows several\ncharacteristic properties. At first the Universe become free from the initial\nsingularity. The second is the origin of the cosmological time is uniquely\ndecided.

Line shifts agree with those expected from light-pressure-induced\nperturbation of atomic velocity distribution.

For a two-level atom, the shift magnitude is determined by the\ncollisional time constant, but when the system has dark states there is an\nadditional time constant due to optical pumping. The collisional and optical\ntime constants compete, and become equal at a certain pressure p_0. Saturation\nsignal vanishes at p_0 whereas signal due to light pressure remains. This leads\nto a dependence of line centers on pressure that exhibits apparently singular\nbehavior at p_0.
