The method is\nbased on the fundamental plane, which we interpret using the aperture\nmass-radius relations derived from lensed image geometries. We apply this\nmethod to our previous sample of 22 lens galaxies with measured redshifts and\nexcellent photometry. Modeling the population with a single mass profile and\nevolutionary history, we find that early-type galaxies are nearly isothermal\n(logarithmic density slope n = 2.06 +/- 0.17, 68% C.L.), and that their stars\nevolve at a rate of dlog(M/L)_B/dz = -0.50 +/- 0.19 (68% C.L.) in the rest\nframe B band. For a Salpeter IMF and a concordance cosmology, this implies a\nmean star formation redshift of <z_f> > 1.5 at 95% confidence. While this model\ncan neatly describe the mean properties of early-type galaxies, it is clear\nthat the scatter of the lens sample is too large to be explained by\nobservational uncertainties alone. We therefore consider statistical models in\nwhich the galaxy population is described by a distribution of star formation\nredshifts. We find that stars must form over a significant range of redshifts\n(Delta z_f > 1.7, 68% C.L.), which can extend as low as z_f = 1 for some\nacceptable models. However, the typical galaxy will still have an old stellar\npopulation (<z_f> > 1.5). The lens sample therefore favors early star formation\nin field ellipticals -- even if we make no a priori assumption regarding the\nshape of the mass distribution in lenses, and include the range of possible\ndeviations from homology in the uncertainties. Our evolution results call into\nquestion several recent claims that early-type galaxies in low-density\nenvironments have much younger stars than those in rich clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2004 16:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, the strengths of the D4000 indices and the\nmetal indices do not support this interpretation. Compared to z=0, the metal\nindices (C4668, Fe4383, CN3883, G4300 and CN2) show that at least half of the\nnon-emission line galaxies in RXJ0152.7-1357 have [alpha/Fe] of 0.2 dex higher,\nand about half of the galaxies have significantly lower metal content. The\ndifferences in stellar populations of the galaxies are associated with the\nlocation of the galaxies relative to the X-ray emission. The galaxies with weak\nC4668 and G4300, as well as galaxies with weak [OII] emission, are located in\nareas of low X-ray luminosity. It is possible that these galaxies are\nexperiencing the effect of the cluster merger taking place in RXJ0152.7-1357 as\n(short) episodes of star formation, while the galaxies in the cores of the\nX-ray sub-clumps are unaffected by the merger. The spectroscopy of the\nRXJ0152.7-1357 galaxies shows for the first time galaxies in a rich cluster at\nintermediate redshift that cannot evolve passively into the present day galaxy\npopulation in rich clusters. Additional physical processes may be at work and\nwe speculate that merging with infalling (disk) galaxies in which stars have\nformed over an extended period might produce the required reduction in\n[alpha/Fe].

Our source sample was\noriginally identified through methanol masers in the Galactic plane, which\nexclusively trace high-mass star-forming regions. (Sub)millimetre continuum and\nmolecular line observations were carried out with SEST/SIMBA, JCMT/SCUBA and\nATNF/Mopra mm-wave telescopes and have allowed us to identify massive ($>20$\nM$_{\\odot}$) and luminous ($>10^3$ L$_{\\odot}$) clumps in each star-forming\nregion. We have also constrained the SED with additional archival IR data, the\nphysical conditions ($T_{dust}$, $L$, $M$) and the chemical composition of each\nmassive clump. Several types of objects were characterised based on the\n$L_{submm}/L_{bol}$ ratio, the dust temperature and the molecular line\nproperties, ranging from class 0-like YSO clusters ($L_{sub}/L_{bol}\\sim1%$,\nT=30 K) to hot molecular clumps ($L_{sub}/L_{bol}\\sim0.1%$, $T=40-200$ K).\nPreliminary high-angular resolution observations for a subset of the sample\nwith the ATNF/ATCA at 3 mm, the VLA at 15, 22 and 43 GHz and Gemini in MIR have\nrevealed that several (proto)stellar objects are embedded in the massive\nclumps: massive protostars, hot cores and hyper-compact HII regions. We have\nthus identified protoclusters of massive YSOs, which are the precursors of the\nOB associations. This sample of Southern Hemisphere star-forming regions will\nbe extremely valuable for the scientific preparation of the ALMA and HSO\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2004 11:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that the operator for\nthe staggered magnetization, transformed for use in the effective theory,\ndiffers from that for the order parameter of the spin model by a\nrenormalization factor accounting for the increased charge fluctuations as t/U\nis increased from the t/U -> 0 Heisenberg limit. These charge fluctuations lead\nto an increase of the quantum fluctuations over and above those for an S=1/2\nantiferromagnet. The renormalization factor ensures that the zero temperature\nstaggered moment for the Hubbard model is a monotonously decreasing function of\nt/U, despite the fact that the moment of the spin Hamiltonien, which depends on\ntransverse spin fluctuations only, in an increasing function of t/U.

Some\nexperiments will soon be able to test some low energy effects of quantum\ngravity, and DSR is a very promising candidate to describe these latter.\nUnfortunately DSR is up to now plagued by many conceptual problems (in\nparticular how it describes macroscopic objects) which forbids a definitive\nphysical interpretation and clear predictions. Here we propose a consistent\nframework to interpret DSR. We extend the principle of relativity: the same way\nthat Special Relativity showed us that the definition of a reference frame\nrequires to specify its speed, we show that DSR implies that we must also take\ninto account its mass. We further advocate a 5-dimensional point of view on DSR\nphysics and the extension of the kinematical symmetry from the Poincare group\nto the Poincare-de Sitter group (ISO(4,1)). This leads us to introduce the\nconcept of a pentamomentum and to take into account the renormalization of the\nDSR deformation parameter kappa. This allows the resolution of the \"soccer ball\nproblem\" (definition of many-particle-states) and provides a physical\ninterpretation of the non-commutativity and non-associativity of the addition\nthe relativistic quadrimomentum. In particular, the coproduct of the\nkappa-Poincare algebra is interpreted as defining the law of change of\nreference frames and not the law of scattering.

The master equation for the\nquantized mode of the field is solved, and the solution is used to describe the\nstatistics of the output field. The conditions under which a nonclassical input\nfield may retain nonclassical features at the output of the amplifier are\nanalyzed and compared to the results of earlier theories. As an application we\ngive a dynamical description of the departure of the system from thermal\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2004 15:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2006 08:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
