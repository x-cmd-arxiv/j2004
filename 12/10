We propose\nhere a test whether a burst with an unknown redshift can potentially satisfy\nthe EpEi relation. Applying this test to a large sample of BATSE bursts we find\nthat a significant fraction of those bursts cannot satisfy this relation. Our\ntest is sensitive only to dim and hard bursts and therefore this relation might\nstill hold as an inequality (i.e. there are no intrinsically bright and soft\nbursts). We conclude that the observed relation seen in the sample of bursts\nwith a known redshift might be influenced by observational biases and from the\ninability to locate and well localize hard and weak bursts that have only a\nsmall number of photons. In particular we point out that the threshold for\ndetection, localization and redshift measurement is essentially higher than the\nthreshold for detection alone. We predict that Swift will detect some hard and\nweak bursts that would be outliers to the EpEi relation. However, we cannot\nquantify this prediction. We stress the importance of understanding the\ndetection-localization-redshift threshold for the coming Swift detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2004 21:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2006 04:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The crossover is determined from the change in slope of\nderivative plots of the relaxation times or viscosities. We confirm our\nprevious findings that the value of tau or eta at the crossover is independent\nof both T and P; that is, the dynamic crossover is associated with a\ncharacteristic value of the relaxation time. Previous determinations were\nlimited to liquids having crossovers occurring at large values of tau (> 10\nmicrosec), whereas by interpolating within T^-1V^-x space, we extend the\nanalysis to smaller values of the crossover time. Using the superpositioned\ndata, the dynamic crossover can be observed in isochoric data, where it is\nfound that the relaxation time at the crossover for constant volume is\nequivalent to the value obtained under (the more usual) condition of constant\npressure. Similarly, from the scaling analysis, isobaric relaxation times at\nhigh pressure are deduced from experimental measurements at atmospheric\npressure.

In this paper, we firstly present a goal-directed\nfixed point computation strategy in the logic programming paradigm. The\nstrategy adopts a tabled resolution (or memorized resolution) to mimic the\nefficient semi-naive bottom-up computation. Its main idea is to dynamically\nidentify and record those clauses that will lead to recursive variant calls,\nand then repetitively apply those alternatives incrementally until the fixed\npoint is reached. Secondly, there are many situations in which a fixed point\ncontains a large number or even infinite number of solutions. In these cases, a\nfixed point computation engine may not be efficient enough or feasible at all.\nWe present a mode-declaration scheme which provides the capabilities to reduce\na fixed point from a big solution set to a preferred small one, or from an\ninfeasible infinite set to a finite one. The mode declaration scheme can be\ncharacterized as a meta-level operation over the original fixed point. We show\nthe correctness of the mode declaration scheme. Thirdly, the mode-declaration\nscheme provides a new declarative method for dynamic programming, which is\ntypically used for solving optimization problems. There is no need to define\nthe value of an optimal solution recursively, instead, defining a general\nsolution suffices. The optimal value as well as its corresponding concrete\nsolution can be derived implicitly and automatically using a mode-directed\nfixed point computation engine. Finally, this fixed point computation engine\nhas been successfully implemented in a commercial Prolog system. Experimental\nresults are shown to indicate that the mode declaration improves both time and\nspace performances in solving dynamic programming problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2004 22:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2005 21:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This problem is NP-hard in general, and,\ntherefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of\nconstraints affects the approximability of the problem. It is known that every\nBoolean (that is, two-valued) Max CSP problem with a finite set of allowed\nconstraint types is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else\nAPX-complete (and hence can have no polynomial time approximation scheme unless\nP=NP.

This leads to a generic problem of distinguishing\nbetween the features of the system and those of the driver. We quantify scaling\nproperties of short term (up to few hours) fluctuations in the geomagnetic\nindices AL and AU during solar minimum and maximum along with the parameter\nepsilon that is a measure of the solar wind driver. We find that self-similar\nstatistics provide a good approximation for the observed scaling properties of\nfluctuations in the geomagnetic indices, regardless of the solar activity\nlevel, and in the epsilon parameter at solar maximum. This self-similarity\npersists for fluctuations on time scales at least up to about 1-2 hours. The\nscaling exponent of AU index fluctuations show dependence on the solar cycle\nand the trend follows that found in the scaling of fluctuations in epsilon. The\nvalues of their corresponding scaling exponents, however, are always distinct.\nFluctuations in the AL index are insensitive to the solar cycle as well as\nbeing distinct from those in the epsilon parameter. This approximate\nself-similar scaling leads to a Fokker-Planck model which, we show, captures\nthe probability density function of fluctuations and provides a stochastic\ndynamical equation (Langevin equation) for time series of the geomagnetic\nindices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2004 14:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The best method so far devised to estimate the contribution of\nside-chain interactions to protein stability is double-mutant-cycle analysis,\nbut the interaction energies so derived are not identical to incremental\nbinding energies (the energies quantifying net contributions of two interacting\ngroups to protein stability). Here we introduce double-deletion analysis of\nisolated residue pairs as a means to precisely quantify incremental binding.\nThe method is exemplified by studying a surface-exposed hydrogen bond in a\nmodel protein (Asp96/Asn128 in apoflavodoxin). Combined substitution of these\nresidues by alanines slightly destabilizes the protein, due to a decrease in\nhydrophobic surface burial. Subtraction of this effect, however, clearly\nindicates that the hydrogen-bonded groups in fact destabilize the native\nconformation. In addition, Molecular Dynamics simulations and classic\ndouble-mutant-cycle analysis explain quantitatively that, due to frustration,\nthe hydrogen bond must form in the native structure because, when the two\ngroups get approximated upon folding their binding becomes favorable. We would\nlike to remark two facts: that this is the first time the contribution of a\nspecific hydrogen bond to protein stability has been measured from experiment,\nand that more hydrogen bonds need to be analyzed in order to draw general\nconclusions on protein hydrogen bonds energetics. To that end, the double\ndeletion method should be of help.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2004 18:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
