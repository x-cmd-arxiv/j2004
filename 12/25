We first obtained a series of solutions for equations describing\nnon-rotating spherically symmetric flows and confirmed the results of preceding\npapers that, for a given mass accretion rate, there is a critical luminosity of\nirradiating neutrinos, above which there exists no steady solution. Below the\ncritical value, we found two branches of solutions; one is stable and the other\nis unstable against radial perturbations. With a simple argument based on the\nRiemann problem, we can identify the critical luminosity as the one, at which\nthe stalled shock revives. We also obtained the condition satisfied by the flow\nvelocity for the critical luminosity, which can be easily applied to the\nrotational case. If a collapsing star rotates, the accretion flow is\nnon-spherical due to centrifugal forces. Flows are accelerated near the\nrotation axis whereas they are decelerated near the equatorial plane. As a\nresult, the critical luminosity is lowered, that is, rotation assists the\nrevival of a stalled shock. According to our calculations, the critical\nluminosity is $\\sim25$% lower for the mass accretion rate of 1M$_{\\odot}$/sec\nand the rotation frequency of 0.1 Hz at a radius of 1000 km than that of the\nspherically symmetric flow with the same mass accretion rate. We found that the\ncondition of the flow velocity at the critical luminosity is first satisfied at\nthe rotation axis. This suggests that the shock revival is triggered on the\nrotation axis and a jet-like explosion ensues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Dec 2004 10:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
