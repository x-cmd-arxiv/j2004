NWB is commonly performed via flooding, which has\nbeen shown to be expensive in dense MANETs because of its high redundancy.\nSeveral efforts have targeted reducing the redundancy of floods.

We do not find any sum rule\nwindow for extracting optimal and reliable results from the LSR, due to the\nunusual slow convergence of the OPE and to the exceptional important role of\nthe QCD continuum into the spectral function in this channel. Instead, we use\nin this channel,for the first time, Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR), which\nexhibit a nice stability in the QCD continuum threshold t_c, at which one can\nextract, with a good accuracy, the mass of the lowest resonance. Including the\nD=7, 9 condensate contributions in the OPE, we obtain M_Theta=(1513+- 114) MeV,\nand the corresponding residue lambda_Theta^2= -(0.14-- 0.49)x 10^{-9} GeV^{12},\nwhich favours the I=0, J=1/2, and negative parity S-wave interpretation of the\nTheta (1540). However, our analysis indicates a degeneracy between the unmixed\nI=0 and I=1 S-wave states.

For this\npurpose, first we develop a simplified version of the Feynman diagram method,\nwhich requires integrals in one variable only, to obtain the generating\nfunctions as asymptotic expansions of certain Gaussian integrals. Finally,\nfollowing Penner, we relate these integrals to the gamma function in order to\ncompute the individual coefficients of the generating functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 2004 13:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 09:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the first RF tests, the beta =\n0.085 QWR reached a peak surface electric field (Ep) in excess of 30 MV/m, with\nan intrinsic quality factor (Q0) in excess of 1E9 at the design field of Ep =\n20 MV/m. The beta = 0.16 QWR reached Ep = 20 MV/m with Q0 = 2.5E9. It is\nsuspected that the performance of the latter cavity can be improved via better\ncooling of the Nb tuning plate and a better RF contact between the plate and\nthe outer conductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2004 20:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
