To account for the role of large spin domains\nin the dynamics, a complete basis expressed in terms of domains of all sizes is\nintroduced.

The fermionic three-body problem is universal and characterized by\ntwo atom-dimer scattering lengths, $a_{ad}$ and $b_{ad}$. In the tightly bound\n`dimer limit', $a_\\perp/a\\to\\infty$, we find $b_{ad}=0$, and $a_{ad}$ is linked\nto the 3D atom-dimer scattering length. In the weakly bound `BCS limit',\n$a_\\perp/a\\to-\\infty$, a connection to the Bethe Ansatz is established, which\nallows for exact results. The full crossover is obtained numerically. The\nbosonic three-body problem, however, is non-universal: $a_{ad}$ and $b_{ad}$\ndepend both on $a_\\perp/a$ and on a parameter $R^*$ related to the sharpness of\nthe resonance. Scattering solutions are qualitatively similar to fermionic\nones. We predict the existence of a single confinement-induced three-body bound\nstate (trimer) for bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2004 11:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 09:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Unfortunately, forming\nsuch network-wide measures can be difficult, due to the issues of scale\ninvolved. In particular, the number of paths grows too rapidly with the number\nof endpoints to make exhaustive measurement practical. As a result, there is\ninterest in the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the number of\npaths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable accuracy.\n  In previous work we proposed a statistical framework to efficiently address\nthis problem, in the context of additive metrics such as delay and loss rate,\nfor which the per-path metric is a sum of (possibly transformed) per-link\nmeasures. The key to our method lies in the observation and exploitation of\nsignificant redundancy in network paths (sharing of common links).\n  In this paper we make three contributions: (1) we generalize the framework to\nmake it more immediately applicable to network measurements encountered in\npractice; (2) we demonstrate that the observed path redundancy upon which our\nmethod is based is robust to variation in key network conditions and\ncharacteristics, including link failures; and (3) we show how the framework may\nbe applied to address three practical problems of interest to network providers\nand customers, using data from an operating network.

This is no longer\nobviously the case if the LSP is a hidden sector field, such as a Gravitino or\nan other hidden sector fermion, so, it is interesting to study this scenario.\nWe consider the case in which the Next-Lightest SuperPartner (NLSP) freezes out\nwith its thermal relic abundance, and then it decays to the LSP.
