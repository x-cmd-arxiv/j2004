We construct twistors in Minkowski spacetime as\nalgebraic spinors associated with the Dirac-Clifford algebra, using one lower\nspacetime dimension than standard Clifford algebra formulations, since for this\npurpose the Clifford algebra over R{4,1} is also used to describe conformal\nmaps, instead of R{2,4}. It is possible to identify the twistor fiber in four,\nsix and eight dimensions, respectively, with the coset spaces SO(4)/(SU(2) x\nU(1)/Z_2) = CP1, SO(6)/(SU(3)x U(1)/Z_2) = CP3 and SO(8)/(Spin(6)x\nSpin(2)/Z_2). The last homogeneous space is closely related to the SO(8) spinor\ndecomposition reserving SO(8) symmetry in type IIB superstring theory. Indeed,\naside the IIB theory, there is no SO(8) spinor decomposition preserving SO(8)\nsymmetry and, in this case, one can introduce distinct coordinates and\nconjugate momenta only if the Spin(8) symmetry is broken by a Spin(6) x Spin(2)\nsubgroup of Spin(8).
