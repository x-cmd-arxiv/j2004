High ionized species such as [SiIX], [SiX], [SIX] and [MgVII] are\nalso observed.

In this approach, the\nWMAP statement excluding the pure phi^4 potential implies the presence of an\ninflaton mass term at the scale m sim 10^{13}GeV. Chaotic, new and hybrid\ninflation is studied in an unified way. In all cases the inflaton potential\ntakes the form V(phi) = m^2 M_{Pl}^2 v(phi/M_{Pl}), where all coefficients in\nthe polynomial v(x) are of order one. If such potential corresponds to super\nsymmetry breaking, the susy breaking scale is sqrt{m M_{Pl}} \\sim 10^{16}GeV\nwhich turns to coincide with the GUT scale.

For\nmetallic plutonium in both phases in agreement with experiment a nonmagnetic\nground state was found with Pu ions in f^6 configuration with zero values of\nspin, orbital, and total moments. This result is determined by a strong\nspin-orbit coupling in 5f shell that gives in LDA calculation a pronounced\nsplitting of 5f states on f^{5/2} and f^{7/2} subbands.

In particular, they increase with increasing\nthe momentum transfer and the asymmetry of the process. Another feature of the\nobtained results is that the nuclear GPD cannot be factorized into a\nDelta^2-dependent and a Delta^2-independent term, as suggested in prescriptions\nproposed for finite nuclei. The dependence of the obtained GPDs on different\nrealistic potentials used in the calculation shows that these quantities are\nsensitive to the details of nuclear structure at short distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 2004 14:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

All physical quantities are defined\nwithout reference frames, the absolute quantities, i.e., they are geometric\nfour dimensional (4D) quantities or, when some basis is introduced, every\nquantity is represented as a 4D coordinate-based geometric quantity comprising\nboth components and a basis. The new observer independent expressions for the\nstress-energy vector T(n)(1-vector), the energy density U (scalar), the\nPoynting vector S and the momentum density g (1-vectors), the angular momentum\ndensity M (bivector) and the Lorentz force K (1-vector) are directly derived\nfrom the field equation for F. The local conservation laws are also directly\nderived from that field equation. The 1-vector Lagrangian with the F field as a\n4D absolute quantity is presented; the interaction term is written in terms of\nF and not, as usual, in terms of A.
