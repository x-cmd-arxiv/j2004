We show that the\nsubalgebra of constants of a factor algebra can be lifted to the subalgebra of\nconstants. 2. For all varieties of associative algebras which are not nilpotent\nin Lie sense the subalgebras of constants of the relatively free algebras of\nrank $\\geq 2$ are not finitely generated. 3. We describe the generators of the\nsubalgebra of constants for all factor algebras $K< x,y>/I$ modulo a\n$GL_2(K)$-invariant ideal $I$. 4. Applying known results from commutative\nalgebra, we construct classes of automorphisms of the algebra generated by two\ngeneric $2\\times 2$ matrices.

We start with a general introduction to\ncalorimetry where the basic elements that characterize the development of\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers are discussed. Then we describe in detail\nthe operation principle and the properties of calorimeters equipped with quartz\nfibers. The main advantages of this type of calorimeters are the radiation\nhardness, the fast response and the compact detector dimensions, features that\nderive from the quartz material and the specific mechanism of operation. A\nsection is devoted to presenting the quartz fiber calorimeters that have been\nbuilt or planned to in various experiments to operate as centrality detectors,\ntrigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose very forward\ncalorimeters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2004 10:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is almost certain that the world is quantum mechanical at\nboth microscopic as well as at macroscopic level. The problem of ontology of a\nQuantum world is a difficult one. It also depends on which interpretation is\nused. We first discuss some interpretations in which Quantum Mechanics does not\nprovide a complete framework but has to be supplemented by extra ingredients\ne.g. (i) Copenhagen group of interpretations associated with the names of Niels\nBohr, Heisenberg, von-Neumann, and (ii) de-Broglie-Bohm interpretations. We\nthen look at some interpretations in which Quantum mechanics is supposed to\nprovide the entire framework such as (i) Everett-deWitt many world, (ii)\nquantum histories interpretations. We conclude with some remarks on the\nrigidity of the formalism of quantum mechanics, which is sharp contrast to it's\nontological fluidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2004 06:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
