Thus, the rigid precession of the\nring is described as a global $m=1$ mode, which originates from a standing wave\nsuperposed on an axisymmetric background. An integral balance condition for the\nmaintenance of the $m=1$ standing-wave can be set up, in which the differential\nprecession induced by the oblateness of the central planet must cancel the\ncontributions of self-gravity, the resonant satellite forcing and collisional\neffects.

These relationships are applied to the Titan ringlet of\nSaturn, which has a secular resonance with the satellite Titan in which the\nring precession period is close to Titan's orbital period.

Spin is transferred from the spin-polarized device\ncurrent to the magnetization of the free layer by the mechanism of incoherent\nmagnon emission by electrons. Our approach is based on the rate equation for\nthe magnon occupation, using Fermi's golden rule for magnon emission and\nabsorption and the non-equilibrium electron distribution for a biased spin\nvalve. The magnon emission reduces the magnetization of the free layer. For\nanti-parallel alignment of the magnetizations of the layers and at a critical\nbias a magnon avalanche occurs, characterized by a diverging effective magnon\ntemperature. This critical behavior can result in magnetization reversal and\nconsequently to suppression of magnon emission.

The\nnuclear structure of these isotopes is particularly interesting due to the\nappearance of a parity-inverted ground state in 11-Be. Our study is performed\nin the framework of the ab initio no-core shell model. Results obtained using\nfour different, high-precision two-nucleon interactions, in model spaces up to\n9\\hbar\\Omega, are shown. For both nuclei, and all potentials, we reach\nconvergence in the level ordering of positive- and negative-parity spectra\nseparately. Concerning their relative position, the positive-parity states are\nalways too high in excitation energy, but a fast drop with respect to the\nnegative-parity spectrum is observed when the model space is increased. This\nbehavior is most dramatic for 11-Be. In the largest model space we were able to\nreach, the 1/2+ level has dropped down to become either the first or the second\nexcited state, depending on which interaction we use. We also observe a\ncontrasting behavior in the convergence patterns for different two-nucleon\npotentials, and argue that a three-nucleon interaction is needed to explain the\nparity inversion. Furthermore, large-basis calculations of 13-C and 11-B are\nperformed. This allows us to study the systematics of the position of the first\nunnatural-parity state in the N=7 isotone and the A=11 isobar.

They argued that this was due to the difference in dimensionality\nspanned by these two alphabets of states. Here we consider similar alphabets,\nbut with the first spin restricted to a fixed small circle of the Bloch sphere.\nIn this case, the dimensionality spanned by the anti-parallel versus parallel\nalphabet is now equal. However, the anti-parallel alphabet is found to still\ncontain more information in general. We generalize this to having N parallel\nspins and M anti-parallel spins. When the pointer member is restricted to a\nsmall circle these alphabets again span spaces of equal dimension, yet in\ngeneral, more directional information can be found for sets with smaller |N-M|\nfor any fixed total number of spins. We find that the optimal POVMs for\nextracting directional information in these cases can always be expressed in\nterms of the Fourier basis. Our results show that dimensionality alone cannot\nexplain the greater information content in anti-parallel combinations of spins\ncompared to parallel combinations. In addition, we describe an LOCC protocol\nwhich extract optimal directional information when the pointer member is\nrestricted to a small circle and a pair of parallel spins are supplied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2004 12:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
