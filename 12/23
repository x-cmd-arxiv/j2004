(iii) The total density\nslope gamma' = 1.9 +- 0.1 (with 0.3 rms scatter in the sample). The intrinsic\nscatter of 15% in gamma' is consistent with local dynamical studies and can\nlead to a 30% rms scatter in inferred values of H_0 from lens time-delays, when\npurely isothermal mass models are assumed. Hence, the common practice to assume\nthat lens galaxies are perfectly isothermal should be abandoned, especially in\ncases where this assumption is critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2004 16:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Early, at the advent of N-body\ncomputer simulations, the importance of tidal fields in galaxy encounters has\nbeen recognized. Orbits are crowded due to tides along spiral arms, where the\nstar formation is enhanced. Low relative velocity encounters lead to galaxy\nmergers. The central dominating galaxies in future clusters form before the\nclusters in a merging process in galaxy groups. Galaxy clusters are composed in\na hierarchical scenario due to relaxation processes between galaxies and galaxy\ngroups. As soon as the overall cluster gravitational potential is built, high\nspeed galaxy versus galaxy encounters start to play a role. These harassment\nevents gradually thicken and shorten spiral galaxy disks leading to the\nformation of S0 galaxies and ellipticals. Another aspect of the high speed\nmotion in the hot and diluted Intracluster Medium (ICM) is the ram pressure\nexerted on the Interstellar Matter (ISM) leading to stripping of the ISM from\nparent spirals. The combinations of tides and ram pressure stripping\nefficiently removes the gas from spirals, quenching the star formation in\ngalactic disks, while triggering it in the tidal arms and at the leading edge\nof gaseous disk. Gas stripping from disks transports the metals to the ICM. In\nsome cases, the gas extracted from the galactic disks becomes self-gravitating\nforming tidal dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2004 12:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

COMBO-17 is\nparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it covers\nobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshifts\nand spectral classification for objects with $R<24$ are derived. This allows us\nto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid any\nuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. We study\ngalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalization\nof either singular isothermal spheres (SIS) or Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\nprofiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and red\nsubsamples separately.

This article presents a unified summary of all 11\ntwo-dimensional uniform Archimedean lattices which include e.g. the square,\ntriangular and kagome lattice. We find that the ground state of the spin-1/2\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet is likely to be semi-classically ordered in most\ncases. However, the interplay of geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations\ngives rise to a quantum paramagnetic ground state without semi-classical\nlong-range order on two lattices which are precisely those among the 11 uniform\nArchimedean lattices with a highly degenerate ground state in the classical\nlimit. The first one is the famous kagome lattice where many low-lying singlet\nexcitations are known to arise in the spin gap. The second lattice is called\nstar lattice and has a clear gap to all excitations.\n  Modification of certain bonds leads to quantum phase transitions which are\nalso discussed briefly. Furthermore, we discuss the magnetization process of\nthe Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the 11 Archimedean lattices, focusing on\nanomalies like plateaus and a magnetization jump just below the saturation\nfield.

This condition may have a\npractical importance both for defining new algorithms for checking consistency\nand computing answer sets, and for improving the existing systems. The approach\nof this paper is to introduce a new canonical form (to which any logic program\ncan be reduced to), to focus the attention on cyclic dependencies. The\ntechnical result is then given in terms of programs in canonical form\n(canonical programs), without loss of generality. The result is based on\nidentifying the cycles contained in the program, showing that stable models of\nthe overall program are composed of stable models of suitable sub-programs,\ncorresponding to the cycles, and on defining the Cycle Graph. Each vertex of\nthis graph corresponds to one cycle, and each edge corresponds to onehandle,\nwhich is a literal containing an atom that, occurring in both cycles, actually\ndetermines a connection between them. In fact, the truth value of the handle in\nthe cycle where it appears as the head of a rule, influences the truth value of\nthe atoms of the cycle(s) where it occurs in the body. We can therefore\nintroduce the concept of a handle path, connecting different cycles. If for\nevery odd cycle we can find a handle path with certain properties, then the\nexistence of stable model is guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2004 12:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
