Quantitatively, we carry out\nMonte Carlo simulations to determine the time-dependent disorder parameter\nA(L;T;t) and the time-dependent structure factors Sk(t) for moderately low\ntemperatures. This study differs from previous studies done at infinite\ntemperature in that the vacancy here executes highly active walks, which are\nsubjected to nonlinear feedbacks, instead of the random walks that take place\nin the limit of T ->infinity. We find that the slope of the log-log plot of\nA(L; T; t) vs. t for finite temperatures follows the temperature dependence\ngiven by the Gompertz function and reaches a limiting value of 1/2 only as the\ntemperature approaches infinity. For the structure factors, namely, Sk(t) vs.\nt, the overall features are similar to those found at infinite T. The two key\ndifferences between our results and those at infinite T are the saturated value\nand the intermediate region in which the portion of the graph whose slope is\nequal to one becomes smaller and is gradually replaced by a curve having a\nslope of 0.5. This last difference is especially evident at very low\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2004 07:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Locality means that the dual action is given by a sum\nover some subset of hypercubes of the dual lattice and the interaction between\ndual variables ranges over one given hypercube. Dual variables are in general\ndiscrete-valued and live on (D-2)-cell of the dual lattice, in close analogy\nwith the XY model. We use our construction to study in details the dual of\nSU(2) principal chiral model in two dimensions. We give dual expressions also\nfor two-point correlation function in arbitrary representation and for the free\nenergy of defects. Leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the dual\nBoltzmann factor are computed and it is proven that at low temperatures it\nconverges to a certain Gaussian distribution uniformly in all fluctuations of\ndual variables. This result enables us to define the semiclassical limit of the\ndual formulation and to determine an analog of the vortex--spin-wave\nrepresentation for the partition function. Such representation is used to\nextract leading perturbative contribution to the correlation function which\nshows power-like decay at weak coupling.
