The identification of a cascade\nemission close to a black-hole event horizon would allow us to observe photons\nentangled with partners that have fallen behind the horizon. The experiment\ninvolves testing the characteristic cos^2(theta) modulation of photon\ntransmission through a pair of polarisers at relative angle theta (Malus' law).\nFor single photons, Malus' law is a remarkable feature of quantum theory: it is\nequivalent to expectation additivity for incompatible observables, and is\ngenerically violated for hidden-variables theories with nonstandard probability\ndistributions. An experiment with entangled states straddling an event horizon\nis motivated by the Hawking information loss puzzle, as well as on general\ngrounds. In principle, one could test the currently observed X-ray photons in\niron lines from black-hole accretion discs. However, only a small fraction\n(~0.6%) have cascade partners, and current X-ray polarimetry does not permit\nsuccessive measurements on a single X-ray photon. A realisable experiment\nrequires the identification of an appropriate cascade in a more convenient\nfrequency band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2004 08:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main challenge is the multiplicity of the ionic\ncharge states, which can hamper the identification in both Z and A of the\nfragments. Three topics are covered. First, a specific set-up for ionization\nchambers, based on a very large gas thickness, is presented. Its satisfactory\nperformances are discussed in light of the observations during a 500A MeV Pb+p\nexperiment performed at the FRS (GSI). As a second topic, the possibility to\nuse a thick layer of matter (a degrader) as a passive measurement device to\nidentify the nuclear charge and the ionic charge state of fragments is\ndiscussed. This method, successfully used for Z identification in experiments\nsuch as Pb+p at 1A GeV, fails to measure the charge states at 500A MeV for the\nsame system. It is shown that surface defects of the degrader are probably\nresponsible for this failure. The third topic is the description of new\nanalysis techniques developed in order to account for and subtract the\ncontribution of polluting charge states in the spectrometer, thus making\npossible a clean estimation of the production cross sections of all fragments.\nThe combination of those new experimental and analysis techniques made the 500A\nMeV spallation experiment a success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2004 02:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

New wave functions of free and non-free quantum systems follow from\nSchroedinger equation after inserting an ansatz. Quantum systems show up as\nprobability waves before measurement. A pure entangled state of a composite\nsystem evolves non-unitarily, only to disentangle itself into a definite state\nafter reduction at the measurement point. A classical space-time point is\ncreated momentarily in this event. Unitarity is restored at that point. The\nnon-Hermitian observables defined in the domain of rigged Hilbert space\ntransform into Hermitian ones at the measurement point. The problem of\npreferred basis is resolved by the requirement of specifying the position of\nmeasurement point. Two theorems prove that time is a non-Hermitian operator,\nthus placing space and time on an equal footing. Bound states are found to need\ndiscrete space-time, which supports its use in loop quantum gravity.\nNon-unitarity in the theory helps buttress the no-boundary proposal; and\nuncertainty relation makes a leeway to singularity-free Quantum Cosmology.\nQuantum Mechanics also accommodates complex and negative probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 2004 16:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
