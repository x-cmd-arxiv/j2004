The general problem is unsolved. Hence, we focus on\ncomparing two commonly used source and channel encoding systems which\ncorrespond to exploiting diversity either at the physical layer through\nparallel channel coding or at the application layer through multiple\ndescription source coding.\n  For on-off channel models, source coding diversity offers better performance.\nFor channels with a continuous range of reception quality, we show the reverse\nis true. Specifically, we introduce a new figure of merit called the distortion\nexponent which measures how fast the average distortion decays with SNR. For\ncontinuous-state models such as additive white Gaussian noise channels with\nmultiplicative Rayleigh fading, optimal channel coding diversity at the\nphysical layer is more efficient than source coding diversity at the\napplication layer in that the former achieves a better distortion exponent.\n  Finally, we consider a third decoding architecture: multiple description\nencoding with a joint source-channel decoding. We show that this architecture\nachieves the same distortion exponent as systems with optimal channel coding\ndiversity for continuous-state channels, and maintains the the advantages of\nmultiple description systems for on-off channels. Thus, the multiple\ndescription system with joint decoding achieves the best performance, from\namong the three architectures considered, on both continuous-state and on-off\nchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2004 01:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

For this, we use a simple model of coexistence of hadronic\ngas and color-singlet Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases in a finite volume. The\nColor-Singlet Partition Function (CSPF) of the QGP cannot be exactly calculated\nand is usually derived within the saddle point approximation.

A numerical finite size scaling analysis of the obtained\ndata allows us to determine the scaling exponents of the QCD DPT.

In particular, we address the\nissue of single particle states, or orbitals, which should be one of the most\nimportant aspects of a quantum many-body theory. We argue that the\nsingle-particle $\\it{Green}$ function provides a most general scheme for\ngenerating these single particle states or orbitals. We call them the\n$\\it{correlated}$ atomic or molecular orbitals to make a distinction from those\ndetermined from $\\it{Hartree-Fock}$ equation. We present the calculation of the\nsingle particle properties (i.e., the electron affinities $(EA's)$ and\nionization potentials $(IP's)$) for the $H_{2}O$ molecule using the correlated\nmolecular orbitals in the context of quantum chemistry with a second-order self\nenergy. We also calculate the total ground state energy with a single $Slater$\nwavefunction determined only from the hole states. Comparisons are made with\navailable experimental data as well as with those from the $\\it{Hartree-Fock}$\nor density functional theory $(DFT)$ calculations. We conclude that the\ncorrelated atomic or molecular orbital approach provides a strictest and most\npowerful method for studying the single-particle properties of atoms or\nmolecules. It also gives a better total energy than do the $\\it{Hartree-Fock}$\nand $\\it{DFT}$ even at the single $\\it{Slater}$ determinant level. It promises\nthat a correlation theory based on the correlated atomic or molecular orbitals\nwill become an approach which possesses the advantages and also overcomes their\nshortcomings of current quantum chemistry methods based on either the\nconventional quantum many-body theory or the $DFT$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2004 02:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
