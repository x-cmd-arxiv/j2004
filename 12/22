The Lyman alpha emission comes\npredominantly from the northwest side of the wind structure spatially, and\nshows a significant redshift relative to the optical lines. Both of these\nproperties are signatures of seeing the line photons backscattered from the far\nside of a prolate or bipolar starburst wind, fitting both with escape\ncalculations and evidence for winds in high-redshift galaxies with net Lyman\nalpha emission.

Using a rigorous thermodynamic\nargument, we show that in the idealized case of vanishing crystalline pinning\nanisotropy the long-wavelength tilt modulus of such a vortex solid vanishes\nidentically, as guaranteed by the underlying rotational invariance. The\nvanishing of the tilt modulus means that, to lowest order, the associated\ntension elasticity is replaced by the softer, curvature elasticity. The effect\nof this is to make the spontaneous vortex solid qualitatively more susceptible\nto the disordering effects of thermal fluctuations and random pinning. We study\nthese effects, taking into account the nonlinear elasticity, that, in three\ndimensions, is important at sufficiently long length scales, and showing that a\n``columnar elastic glass'' phase of vortices results.

We have introduced a method through which we\nwere able to follow the time evolution of the wave packets for both spins\nshowed in three-dimensional plots, and have evaluated, for each particle, the\ncorresponding $MSD^{\\prime}s $ and the centroids as function of time . These\nmeasurements allow us to determine the influence of the interaction on\ndynamical properties. We discussed the combined effect that the extension of\nthe initial wave packets and the interaction strength have on propagating\nproperties. Under certain conditions we obtained an entanglement of the two\npackets associated with both spins that takes place in a small region of the\nlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 22:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, they relate several thermodynamic quantities to the slope\nof the metal-insulator phase boundary drawn in the plane of the chemical\npotential and the Coulomb interaction in the phase diagram of the Hubbard\nmodel. The relations impose constraints on the critical properties of the Mott\ntransition. These thermodynamic relations are indeed confirmed to be satisfied\nin the cases of the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models. One of these\nrelations yields that at the continuous Mott transition with a diverging charge\ncompressibility, the doublon susceptibility also diverges. The constraints on\nthe shapes of the phase boundary containing a first-order metal-insulator\ntransition at finite temperatures are clarified based on the thermodynamic\nrelations. For example, the first-order phase boundary is parallel to the\ntemperature axis asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. The\napplicability of the thermodynamic relations are not restricted only to the\nmetal-insulator transition of the Hubbard model, but also hold in correlated\nsystems with any types of phases in general.

Numerical diagonalization furthermore shows that eigenstates\nergodically spread across the entire chain for v>0, while in the limit as v->0\nergodicity is broken and eigenstates spread only across clusters of the same\ntype, in contradistinction with trivial localization at v=0. An investigation\nof the effects of a single-site perturbation on wave-packet dynamics shows\nthat, by changing the position or strength of such an impurity, it is possible\nto control the long-time wave-packet dynamics. By adding a single impurity it\nis possible to induce wave-packet localization on individual subchains as well\nas on the whole chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2004 13:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In contrast, automata-based approaches often yield\nalgorithms for which optimal worst-case complexity can easily be proved.\nHowever, the algorithms obtained this way are usually not only worst-case, but\nalso best-case exponential: they first construct an automaton that is always\nexponential in the size of the input, and then apply the (polynomial) emptiness\ntest to this large automaton. To overcome this problem, one must try to\nconstruct the automaton \"on-the-fly\" while performing the emptiness test.\n  In this paper we will show that Voronkov's inverse method for the modal logic\nK can be seen as an on-the-fly realization of the emptiness test done by the\nautomata approach for K. The benefits of this result are two-fold. First, it\nshows that Voronkov's implementation of the inverse method, which behaves quite\nwell in practice, is an optimized on-the-fly implementation of the\nautomata-based satisfiability procedure for K. Second, it can be used to give a\nsimpler proof of the fact that Voronkov's optimizations do not destroy\ncompleteness of the procedure. We will also show that the inverse method can\neasily be extended to handle global axioms, and that the correspondence to the\nautomata approach still holds in this setting. In particular, the inverse\nmethod yields an EXPTIME-algorithm for satisfiability in K w.r.t. global\naxioms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 2004 14:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here the potential\ndetermines the final distribution of population. Our demonstration consists of\nthree steps: We first show the existence of limit from a typical physical\nsciences setting: the potential is a type of Mexican hat type, with the\nstrength of a magnetic field scale with the strength the potential gradient\nnear the limit cycle, and the friction goes to zero faster than the potential\nnear the limit cycle. Hence the dynamics at the limit cycle is conserved. The\ndiffusion matrix is nevertheless finite at the limit cycle. Secondly, we\nconstruct the potential in the dynamics with limit cycle in a typical dynamical\nsystems setting. Thirdly, we argue that such a construction can be carried out\nin a more general situation based on a method discovered by one of us. This\nmethod of dealing with stochastic differential equation is in general different\nfrom both Ito and Stratonovich calculus. Our result may be useful in many\nrelated applications, such as in the discussion of metastability of limit cycle\nand in the construction of Hopfield potential in the neural network\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 20:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
