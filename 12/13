We show how the shape of the dark\nenergy potential can be recovered non parametrically using this formalism and\nwe present approximations analogous to the ones relevant to slow-roll\ninflation. Since presently available data do not allow a non-parametric and\nexact reconstruction of the potential, we consider a general parametric\ndescription. This reconstruction can also be used in other approaches followed\nin the literature (e.g., the reconstruction of the redshift evolution of the\ndark energy equation of state w(z)). Using observations of passively evolving\ngalaxies and supernova data we derive constraints on the dark energy potential\nshape in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8.

Our spectroscopic observations however show that the\nK0V primary is a single-line spectroscopic binary with a period of 3.3 years.\nThe minimum mass of the invisible component is about 0.9 Mo which means that\nthe mass of the companion is about the same as that of the primary. The first\ninspection of our FEROS spectra, as well as a CES spectrum shows no obvious\ncompanion. However, when the FEROS spectra are cross-correlated with an M-star,\na secondary becomes visible as a broad peak in the cross-correlation function.\nThe width and the position of this broad peak is variable on a short\ntime-scale.

Less massive galaxies tend\nto be ungrouped blue star-forming discs, while more massive galaxies are\ntypically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap\nbetween the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at\nz~1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L_*, and massive starbursts at\nz~2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of\nthe inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback\nprocesses, all functions of the dark-matter halo mass and associated with a\nsimilar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass\nM_shock~10^{12}Msun, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial\nshock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova\nfeedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a\n\"fundamental line\". Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>M_shock\nhaloes preferentially at z>2 lead to massive starbursts in L>L_* galaxies. At\nz<2, in M>M_shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock,\nand being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such\nas AGNs. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading\nby passive evolution to \"red-and-dead\" massive spheroids starting at z~1. A\nminimum in feedback efficiency near M_shock explains the observed minimum in\nM/L and the qualitative features of the star-formation history. The cold flows\nprovide a hint for solving the angular-momentum problem.

The\nspecific Penrose limit is the background known as the Nappi-Witten spacetime,\nwhich is a plane-wave background with an axion field. The string theory on it\nis given as the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model on non-semi-simple\ngroup H_4. It is found that, in the past literature, an important type of\nirreducible representations of the corresponding algebra, h_4, were missed. We\npresent this \"new\" representations, which have the type of continuous series\nrepresentations. All the three types of representations of the previous\nliterature can be obtained from the \"new\" representations by setting the\nmomenta in the theory to special values. Then we realized the affine currents\nof the WZNW model in terms of four bosonic free fields and constructed the\nspectrum of the theory by acting the negative frequency modes of free fields on\nthe ground level states in the h_4 continuous series representation. The\nspectrum is shown to be free of ghosts, after the Virasoro constraints are\nsatisfied. In particular we argued that there is no need for constraining one\nof the longitudinal momenta to have unitarity. The tachyon vertex operator,\nthat correspond to a particular state in the ground level of the string\nspectrum, is constructed. The operator products of the vertex operator with the\ncurrents and the energy-momentum tensor are shown to have the correct forms,\nwith the correct conformal weight of the vertex operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 09:34:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 11:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2005 20:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 May 2005 11:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In \\cite{EP99},\nthe compact support property was shown to be equivalent to a certain analytic\ncriterion concerning uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for the semilinear\nparabolic equation related to the measured valued diffusion. In a subsequent\npaper \\cite{EP03}, this analytic property was investigated purely from the\npoint of view of partial differential equations. Some of the results obtained\nin this latter paper yield interesting results concerning the compact support\nproperty. In this paper, the results from \\cite{EP03} that are relevant to the\ncompact support property are presented, sometimes with extensions. These\nresults are interwoven with new results and some informal heuristics. Taken\ntogether, they yield a fairly comprehensive picture of the compact support\nproperty. \\it Inter alia\\rm, we show that the concept of a measure-valued\ndiffusion \\it hitting\\rm a point can be investigated via the compact support\nproperty, and suggest an alternate proof of a result concerning the hitting of\npoints by super-Brownian motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 11:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
