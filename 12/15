The most promising way of probing it\nis through polarization measurements of the synchrotron emission from the GRB\nejecta, which includes the gamma-ray emission and the reverse shock emission.\nMeasuring polarization in gamma-rays with current instruments is extremely\ndifficult: so far there is only one claim of detection (in GRB 021206) which\ndespite the favorable conditions remains very controversial. The emission from\nthe reverse shock that propagates into the ejecta as it is decelerated by the\nambient medium peaks in the optical after tens of seconds (the `optical flash')\nand dominates the optical emission up to about ten minutes after the GRB.\nUnfortunately, no polarization measurements of this optical emission have been\nmade to date. However, after the reverse shock finishes crossing the shell of\nGRB ejecta, the shocked ejecta cools adiabatically and radiates at lower and\nlower frequencies, peaking in the radio after $\\sim 1$ day (the `radio flare').\nWe use VLA data of radio flares from GRBs to constrain the polarization of this\nemission. We find only upper limits for both linear and circular polarization.\nOur best limits are for GRB 991216, for which we find $3\\sigma$ upper limits on\nthe linear and circular polarization of 7% and 9%, respectively. These limits\nprovide interesting constraints on existing GRB models. Specifically, our\nresults are hard to reconcile with a predominantly ordered toroidal magnetic\nfield in the GRB outflow together with a `structured' jet, where the energy per\nsolid angle drops as the inverse square of the angle from the jet axis, that is\nexpected in models where the outflow is Poynting flux dominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2004 20:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2005 02:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this case, the known OVI absorbers should show stronger OVII\nabsorption than expected from collisional-ionization equilibrium (and much more\nthan expected for photoionized systems). We then argue that higher-temperature\nshocks will be spatially associated with more massive virialized objects even\nwell outside the virial radius. Thus the different oxygen ions will trace\ndifferent structures; OVII absorbers are the most common because that ion\ndominates over a wide temperature range (corresponding to a large range in halo\nmass). If each dark-matter halo is surrounded by a network of shocks with total\ncross section a few times the size of the virialized systems, then we can\nreproduce the observed number densities of absorbers with plausible parameters.\nA simple comparison with simulations shows that these assumptions are\nreasonable, although the actual distribution of shocked gas is too complex for\nanalytic models to describe fully.

During this time it heats particles at\nr\\gtrsim 10^9 cm to relativistic energies and enables extra plasma to be\ntrapped by magnetic mirroring. An enhancement of the plasma density by a factor\n\\sim 10^2 is required to match the duration and optical depth of the observed\neclipses.

Excitation of\npairs' gyrational motions by cyclotron absorption of A's radio beam can result\nin their becoming trapped between conjugate mirror points in B's magnetosphere.\nBecause the trapping efficiency decreases with increasing optical depth, the\nplasma density enhancement saturates even under steady state illumination.

After\nillumination by A's radio beam ceases, the trapped particles cool and are lost.\nThe entire cycle repeats every orbital period.

In this paper we show that networks with and without\nweight-topology correlations can emerge from the same simple growth dynamics of\nthe node connectivities and of the link weights. A weighted fitness network is\nintroduced in which both nodes and links are assigned intrinsic fitness. This\nmodel can show a local dependence of the weight-topology correlations and can\nundergo a phase transition to a state in which the network is dominated by few\nlinks which acquire a finite fraction of the total weight of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 11:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2004 14:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2005 17:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

When one\ntries to construct this formalism with the Ginsparg-Wilson fermion including\nthe overlap Dirac operator and the domain-wall fermion one easily runs into\ndifficulties. The reason is that if the Dirichlet boundary condition is simply\nimposed on the Wilson Dirac operator $DW$ inside of the overlap Dirac operator\nan exponentially small eigenvalue appears in $DW$, which affects the locality\nproperties of the operator. In this paper we propose a new procedure to impose\nthe Schroedinger functional Dirichlet boundary condition on the overlap Dirac\noperator using an orbifolding projection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 08:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2006 07:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For these channels it is\nknown that there are cases where two orthogonal states are sufficient, two\nnon-orthogonal states are required, or three states are necessary. Here a\nsystematic theory is given which provides criteria to distinguish cases where\ntwo states are sufficient, and determine whether these two states should be\northogonal or non-orthogonal. In addition, we prove a theorem on the form of\nthe optimal ensemble when three states are required, and present efficient\nmethods of calculating the Holevo capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 03:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Recently the adiabatic evolution has been used to design and\nreproduce quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm. In this paper, we\nshow that quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution has two properties\nthat conventional quantum search algorithm doesn't have. Firstly, we show that\nin the initial state of the algorithm only the amplitude of the basis state\ncorresponding to the solution affects the running time of the algorithm, while\nother amplitudes do not. Using this property, if we know a priori probability\nabout the location of the solution before search, we can modify the adiabatic\nevolution to make the algorithm faster. Secondly, we show that by a factor for\nthe initial and finial Hamiltonians we can reduce the running time of the\nalgorithm arbitrarily. Especially, we can reduce the running time of adiabatic\nsearch algorithm to a constant time independent of the size of the database.\nThe second property can be extended to other adiabatic algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 12:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
