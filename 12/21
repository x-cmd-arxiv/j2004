Two recent estimates of the field star IMF using\ndifferent methods and samples give values of the average logarithmic slope\n$\\Gamma$ between -1.7 and -2.1 in the mass range 1.1 to 4 M${_\\odot}$.

It seems plausible that the size of the\nsmallest self-assembly program that builds a shape and the shape's\ndescriptional (Kolmogorov) complexity should be related. We show that when\nusing a notion of a shape that is independent of scale, this is indeed so: in\nthe Tile Assembly Model, the minimal number of distinct tile types necessary to\nself-assemble a shape, at some scale, can be bounded both above and below in\nterms of the shape's Kolmogorov complexity. As part of the proof of the main\nresult, we sketch a general method for converting a program outputting a shape\nas a list of locations into a set of tile types that self-assembles into a\nscaled up version of that shape. Our result implies, somewhat\ncounter-intuitively, that self-assembly of a scaled-up version of a shape often\nrequires fewer tile types. Furthermore, the independence of scale in\nself-assembly theory appears to play the same crucial role as the independence\nof running time in the theory of computability. This leads to an elegant\nformulation of languages of shapes generated by self-assembly. Considering\nfunctions from integers to shapes, we show that the running-time complexity,\nwith respect to Turing machines, is polynomially equivalent to the scale\ncomplexity of the same function implemented via self-assembly by a finite set\nof tile types. Our results also hold for shapes defined by Wang tiling -- where\nthere is no sense of a self-assembly process -- except that here time\ncomplexity must be measured with respect to non-deterministic Turing machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 10:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-22"}

In the renormalizable sector of the\ntheory, all quantum corrections to the Higgs mass proportional to mass scales\ngreater than 1 TeV are absent -- this includes quadratically divergent,\nlog-divergent, and finite loops at all orders. However, even loops proportional\nto scales just a factor of 10 above the Higgs (or any other scalar) mass come\nwith large numerical factors that reintroduce fine-tuning. Top loops, for\nexample, produce an expansion parameter of not 1/(4 pi) but 1/5. The geometric\nincrease in the number of fields at higher energies simply exacerbates this\nproblem. We build a complete two-stage model up to 100 TeV, show that direct\nsensitivity of the electroweak scale to the cutoff is erased, and estimate the\ntuning due to large numerical factors.

Ideal points lying beyond projective infinity arise\nnaturally in both the geometric and analytic arguments. An existence theorem\nfor weakly harmonic 1-fields, changing type on the unit circle, is derived\nunder Dirichlet conditions imposed on the non-characteristic portion of the\nboundary.

By means of\nnumerical computations we quantify the energy transfer into zonal flows owing\nto each of these effects. The importance of the three driving ingredients in\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic turbulence for conditions relevant to the\nedge of fusion devices is revealed for a broad range of parameters. The\nReynolds stress is found to provide a flow drive, while the electromagnetic\nMaxwell stress is in the cases considered a sink for the flow energy. In the\nlimit of high plasma beta, where electromagnetic effects and Alfv\\'en dynamics\nare important, the Maxwell stress is found to cancel the Reynolds stress to a\nhigh degree. The geodesic oscillations, related to equilibrium pressure profile\nmodifications due to poloidally asymmetric transport, can act as both sinks as\ndrive terms, depending on the parameter regime. For high beta cases the GAMs\nare the main drive of the flow. This is also reflected in the frequency\ndependence of the flow, showing a distinct peak at the GAM frequency in that\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
