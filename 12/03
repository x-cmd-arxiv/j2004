Using photometric and spectroscopic data from the Las Campanas Observatory\nand Anglo-Australian Telescope Rich Cluster Survey, Abell 22 is found to\nexhibit a highly unusual and striking redshift distribution. We show that Abell\n22 exhibits a foreground wall-like structure by examining the galaxy\ndistributions in both redshift space and on the colour-magnitude plane. A\nsearch for other galaxies and clusters in the nearby region using the 2dF\nGalaxy Redshift Survey database suggests that the wall-like structure is a\nsignificant large-scale, non-virialized filament which runs between two other\nAbell clusters either side of Abell 22. The filament stretches over at least\n>40 Mpc in length and 10 Mpc in width at the redshift of Abell 22.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2004 05:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Archive optical data (CFHR12k: B and R images), and X-ray\n(Chandra) and radio (VLA) observations are also analysed. The main goal of the\npresent analysis is the investigation of the connection between internal\ncluster dynamics and star formation history, aimed at understanding the complex\nmechanisms of cluster formation and evolution. The analysis of the internal\ndynamics of the cluster and the study of the galaxy luminosity function (LF)\nsuggest an observational scenario in which ABCG 209 is undergoing a strong\ndynamical evolution with the merging of two or more subclumps along the SE-NW\ndirection in a plane which is not parallel to the plane of sky. The effect of\ncluster environment on the global properties of the cluster galaxies is\nexamined through the analysis of the LFs, colour-magnitude relations, and\naverage colours.Moreover cluster dynamics and large-scale structure have a\nstrong influence on galaxy evolution, so it is performed a detailed study of\nspectroscopic properties of 102 luminous member galaxies. All the results\nsupport an evolutionary scenario in which ABCG 209 is characterized by a sum of\ntwo components: an old galaxy population, formed very earlier (z >~ 3), and a\nyounger population of infalling galaxies. Moreover this cluster may have\nexperimented 1 or 2 Gyrs ago a merging with an infalling galaxy group, as\nindicated also by the previous dynamical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2004 08:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To avoid working with the dense primal variable, we\napply Fukuda et al.'s theory of partial matrix completion and work with partial\nmatrices instead. The other place in the algorithm where sparsity should be\nexploited is in the computation of the search direction, where the gradient and\nthe Hessian-matrix product of the primal and dual barrier functions must be\ncomputed in every iteration. By using an idea from automatic differentiation in\nbackward mode, both the gradient and the Hessian-matrix product can be computed\nin time proportional to the time needed to compute the barrier functions of\nsparse variables itself.

Then it is shown that spin\nnetwork functionals arise naturally on the foliations. The graphs of these spin\nnetwork functionals are dual to the triangulations of the foliating\nhypersurfaces.

The\ncondition of resonant dissipation predicts angular momenta for the metastable\norbits in reasonable agreement with the Bohr atom.

To this end, we represent both\nprotein sequences and protein structures as vectors: Structures are represented\nby the principal eigenvector (PE) of the protein contact matrix, a quantity\nthat resembles closely the effective connectivity of each site; Sequences are\nrepresented through the ``interactivity'' of each amino acid type, using novel\nparameters that are correlated with hydropathy scales. These interactivity\nparameters are more strongly correlated than the other hydropathy scales that\nwe examine with: (1) The change upon mutations of the unfolding free energy of\nproteins with two-states thermodynamics; (2) Genomic properties as the\ngenome-size and the genome-wide GC content; (3) The main eigenvectors of the\nsubstitution matrices. The evolutionary average of the interactivity vector\ncorrelates very strongly with the PE of a protein structure. Using this result,\nwe derive an analytic expression for site-specific distributions of amino acids\nacross protein families in the form of Boltzmann distributions whose ``inverse\ntemperature'' is a function of the PE component.

In addition, the\nfraction of genes that are active decreases with the number of inputs per node.\nThese results are based upon investigating ensembles of networks using\nanalytical methods. Also, for different in-degree distributions, the numbers of\nfixed points and cycles are calculated, with results intuitively consistent\nwith stability analysis; fewer inputs per node implies more cycles, and vice\nversa. There are hints that genetic networks acquire broader degree\ndistributions with evolution, and hence our results indicate that for single\ncells, the dynamics should become more stable with evolution.
