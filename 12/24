The CP violating Majorana phases do not play a role in generating\na Berry phase. We show that a natural way to satisfy the conditions for the\ngeneration of a Berry phase is to have sterile neutrinos with active-sterile\nneutrino mixing, in which case at least two active and one sterile neutrinos\nare required. If there are additional new CP violating flavor changing\ninteractions, it is also possible to have a non-zero Berry phase with just two\ngenerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2004 03:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2005 19:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2005 02:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 04:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This model is closely related to the\nDrossel-Schwabl forest-fire model, which has received much attention in the\nphysics literature. The most interesting behaviour seems to occur when the\nlightning rate goes to zero. In the physics literature it is believed that then\nthe system has so-called self-organized critical behaviour.\n  We let the system start with all sites vacant and study, for positive but\nsmall lambda,the behaviour near the `critical time' tc; that is, the time after\nwhich in the modified system without lightning an infinite occupied cluster\nwould emerge.\n  Intuitively one might expect that if, for fixed t > tc, we let simultaneously\nlambda tend to 0 and m to infinity, the probability that some tree at distance\nsmaller than m from O is burnt before time t goes to 1.

Spin motion on the periodic\nclosed orbit of a storage ring can be analyzed in terms of the Floquet theorem\nfor equations of motion with periodic parameters and a spin precession\nfrequency emerges in a Floquet exponent as an additional frequency of the\nsystem. To define a spin precession frequency on nonperiodic synchro-betatron\norbits we exploit the important concept of quasiperiodicity. This allows a\ngeneralization of the Floquet theorem so that a spin precession frequency can\nbe defined in this case too. This frequency appears in a Floquet-like exponent\nas an additional frequency in the system in analogy with the case of motion on\nthe closed orbit. These circumstances lead naturally to the definition of the\nuniform precession rate and a definition of spin tune. A spin tune is a uniform\nprecession rate obtained when certain conditions are fulfilled. Having defined\nspin tune we define spin-orbit resonance on synchro--betatron orbits and\nexamine its consequences. We give conditions for the existence of uniform\nprecession rates and spin tunes (e.g. where small divisors are controlled by\napplying a Diophantine condition) and illustrate the various aspects of our\ndescription with several examples. The formalism also suggests the use of\nspectral analysis to ``measure'' spin tune during computer simulations of spin\nmotion on synchro-betatron orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 2004 20:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Firstly, for some pure\nstate transformations that are impossible under local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC), we demonstrate that they become possible with a\nsurprisingly large success probability under PPT-operations. Furthermore, we\nclarify the convertibility of arbitrary multipartite pure states under\nPPT-operations, and show that a drastic simplification in the classification of\npure state entanglement occurs when the set of operations is switched from LOCC\nto PPT-operations. Indeed, the infinitely many types of LOCC-incomparable\nentanglement are reduced to only one type under the action of PPT-operations.\nThis is a clear manifestation of the increased power afforded by the use of\nPPT-bound entanglement. In addition, we further enlarge the set of operations\nto clarify the effect of another type of bound entanglement, multipartite\nunlockable bound entanglement, and show that a further simplification occurs.\nAs compared to pure states a more complicated situation emerges in the mixed\nstate settings. While single copy distillation becomes possible under\nPPT-operations for some mixed states it remains impossible for other mixed\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2004 06:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2005 16:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The fundamental theory\nof objective probability is quantum mechanics: it is argued that neither Bohr's\nCopenhagen interpretation, nor the pilot-wave theory, nor stochastic\nstate-reduction theories, give a satisfactory answer to the question of what\nobjective probabilities are in quantum mechanics, or why they should satisfy\nthe Born rule; nor do they give any reason why subjective probabilities should\ntrack objective ones.\n  But it is shown that if probability only arises with decoherence, then they\nmust be given by the Born rule. That further, on the Everett interpretation, we\nhave a clear statement of what probabilities are, in terms of purely\ncategorical physical properties; and finally, along lines recently laid out by\nDeutsch and Wallace, that there is a clear basis in the axioms of decision\ntheory as to why subjective probabilities should track these objective ones.\n  These results hinge critically on the absence of hidden-variables or any\nother mechanism (such as state-reduction) from the physical interpretation of\nthe theory.\n  The account of probability has traditionally been considered the principal\nweakness of the Everett interpretation; on the contrary it emerges as one of\nits principal strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2004 13:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
