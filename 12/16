Numerical simulations support the hypothesis\nthat the Jeans mass at this transition point plays an important role in\ndetermining the peak mass of the IMF. A filamentary geometry may also play a\nkey role in the fragmentation process because the isothermal case is a critical\none for the collapse of a cylinder: the collapse and fragmentation of a\ncylinder can continue freely as long as the temperature continues to decrease,\nbut not if it begins to increase.

Nonetheless,\nfor the 2500-3500 K temperature range the temperatures that we derive from\nsynthetic spectral fits are higher than expected from more empirical methods by\nseveral hundred K. In order to reconcile our findings with the empirical\ntemperature scale it is necessary to invoke warming of the model atmosphere\nused to construct the synthetic spectra. We consider that the most likely\nreason for the back-warming is missing high temperature opacity due to water\nvapour. We compare the water vapour opacity of the Partridge & Schwenke (1997)\nline list used for the model atmosphere with the output from a preliminary\ncalculation by Barber & Tennyson (2004). While the Partridge & Schwenke line\nlist is a reasonable spectroscopic match for the new line list at 2000 K, by\n4000 K it is missing around 25% of the water vapour opacity. We thus consider\nthat the offset between empirical and synthetic temperature scales is explained\nby the lack of hot water vapour used for computation of the synthetic spectra.\nFor our coolest objects with temperatures below 2500 K we find best fits when\nusing synthetic spectra which include dust emission. Our spectra also allow us\nto constrain the rotational velocities of our sources, and these velocities are\nconsistent with the broad trend of rotational velocities increasing from M to\nL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 20:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These stars are overabundant, relative to Fe, in C and O. We assume\nthat the observed abundances of species like C, O, Si and Fe are representative\nof the gas from which the currently observed metal-deficient stars formed.\nUnder this assumption, we find that this primordial metal abundance pattern has\nprofound consequences for the thermal balance and chemical composition of the\ngas, and hence for the EOS of the parental cloud. The polytopic EOS is soft for\nlow, [O/H]<10^{-3}, oxygen abundances, but stiffens to a polytropic index gamma\nlarge than unity for [O/H]>10^{-2} due to the large opacity in the CO and H2O\ncooling lines. It is further found that a regulating role is played by the\npresence and temperature of the dust, even when the overall carbon abundance is\nonly [C/H]~10^{-2}.

We have investigated the quality factor, Q, of the\noscillations (defined as the ratio of the frequency of the QPO peak to its full\nwidth at half maximum). In order to minimise the effect of long-term frequency\ndrifts, power spectra were computed over the shortest times permitted by the\ndata statistics. We show that the high Q of ~200 reported by Berger et al.\n(1996) for the lower frequency kilo-Hz QPO in one of their observations is by\nno means exceptional, as we observe a mean Q value in excess of 150 in 14 out\nof the 21 observations analysed and Q can remain above 200 for thousands of\nseconds. The frequency of the QPO varies over the wide range 560--890 Hz and we\nfind a systematic trend for the coherence time of the QPO, estimated as tau=Q\n/(pi nu), to increase with the frequency, up to a maximum level at ~ 800 Hz,\nbeyond which it appears to decrease, at frequencies where the QPO weakens.\nThere is a more complex relationship between tau and the QPO root mean squared\namplitude (RMS), in which positive and negative correlations can be found. A\nhigher-frequency QPO, revealed by correcting for the frequency drift of the\n560-890 Hz one, has a much lower Q (~10) which does not follow the same\npattern. We discuss these results in the framework of competing QPO models and\nshow that those involving clumps orbiting within or above the accretion disk\nare ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2004 14:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In combination with\npressure-volume-temperature measurements, the dielectric data were used to\nassess the respective roles of thermal energy and density in controlling the\nrelaxation times and their variation with T and P.

It is believed that this network is responsible for\nthe variety and complexity of terrestrial life. We conjecture that this\nregulatory network is more properly viewed as an RNA ``community'', composed of\na rich and largely unexplored biochemical web of RNA interactions. Viewed as an\nRNA-community, we hypothesize that the RNA regulatory network of higher\neukaryotes can re-wire itself, and employ various and evolvable mutational\nstrategies in response to external pressures. Thus, we argue that much\nevolutionary change is due to intracellular, RNA-mediated learning processes.\nSuccessful strategies and pathways are then recorded (hard-wired) into the DNA\ngenome via reverse transcriptase. We present evidence which is consistent with\nthis viewpoint, and make specific predictions which could be used to test the\nutility of our framework. If essentially correct, the RNA-community view of\neukaryotic cells could reconcile measured point mutation and gene duplication\nrates with actual rates of evolutionary change. Futhermore, the RNA-community\nview of eukaryotic cells suggests that agent-based modeling techniques, used in\nmathematical economics, game theory, and neuroscience, will likely be as useful\nin understanding the functioning of eukaryotic cells as the pathway-based\napproaches of systems biology. We conclude this paper by arguing that a\nsufficient amount of biological knowledge has been accumulated to initiate a\nsystematic program of experimental and computational studies of the origins and\nmacroevolution of terrestrial life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 16:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2005 05:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
