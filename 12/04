In particular, the scale\nlength of the intensity perturbation varies directly with the dissipation scale\nlength (i.e., damping length) and the scale lengths of pressure, temperature,\nand velocity. We simulate wave propagation in three different equilibrium loop\nmodels and find that dissipation and pressure and temperature stratification\nare the most important effects in the low corona where the waves are most\neasily detected.

For a constant density (ISM) model, a neutron-rich early afterglow is\ncharacterized by a slowly rising lightcurve followed by a sharp re-brightening\nbump caused by collision between the leading neutron decay trail ejecta and the\ntrailing ion ejecta.

The address\nautoconfiguration, also known as initialization or naming, consists to give a\nunique identifier ranging from 1 to $n$ for a set of $n$ indistinguishable\nnodes. We consider a wireless network where $n$ nodes (processors) are randomly\nthrown in a square $X$, uniformly and independently. We assume that the network\nis synchronous and two nodes are able to communicate if they are within\ndistance at most of $r$ of each other ($r$ is the transmitting/receiving\nrange). The model of this paper concerns nodes without the collision detection\nability: if two or more neighbors of a processor $u$ transmit concurrently at\nthe same time, then $u$ would not receive either messages. We suppose also that\nnodes know neither the topology of the network nor the number of nodes in the\nnetwork. Moreover, they start indistinguishable, anonymous and unnamed. Under\nthis extremal scenario, we design and analyze a fully distributed protocol to\nachieve the initialization task for a wireless multihop network of $n$ nodes\nuniformly scattered in a square $X$. We show how the transmitting range of the\ndeployed stations can affect the typical characteristics such as the degrees\nand the diameter of the network. By allowing the nodes to transmit at a range\n$r= \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+\\ell) \\ln{n} \\SIZE}{\\pi n}}$ (slightly greater than the one\nrequired to have a connected network), we show how to design a randomized\nprotocol running in expected time $O(n^{3/2} \\log^2{n})$ in order to assign a\nunique number ranging from 1 to $n$ to each of the $n$ participating nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 2004 16:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Infinite momentum\nphysical states contain both quarks and a universal ``anomalous wee gluon''\ncomponent, and the spectrum is more limited than is required by confinement and\nchiral symmetry breaking. The pomeron is approximately a regge pole and the\nCritical Pomeron describes asymptotic cross-sections.\n  The strong coupling of the pomeron to the electroweak sector could produce\nlarge $x$ and $Q^2$ events at HERA, and vector boson pairs at Fermilab.
