Using the static orientational correlators from Percus-Yevick\ntheory we find an ideal glass transition generated due to precursors of\norientational order which depend on X and p, the aspect ratio and packing\nfraction of the ellipsoids. The glass formation of oblate ellipsoids is\nenhanced compared to that for prolate ones. For oblate ellipsoids with X <~ 0.7\nand prolate ellipsoids with X >~ 4, the critical diagonal nonergodicity\nparameters in reciprocal space exhibit more or less sharp maxima at the zone\ncenter with very small values elsewhere, while for prolate ellipsoids with 2 <~\nX <~ 2.5 we have maxima at the zone edge. The off-diagonal nonergodicity\nparameters are not restricted to positive values and show similar behavior. For\n0.7 <~ X <~ 2, no glass transition is found. In the glass phase, the\nnonergodicity parameters show a pronounced q-dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2004 18:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2005 16:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2005 22:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2005 09:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The simplest scenarios of this type consist of extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) by an\nextra U(1)_X gauge group with Stueckelberg type couplings. For the SM, the\nphysical spectrum is extended by a massive neutral gauge boson Z' only, while\nthe extension of the MSSM contains a CP-even neutral scalar and two extra\nneutralinos. The new gauge boson Z' can be very light compared to other models\nwith U(1)' extensions. Among the new features of the Stueckelberg extension of\nthe MSSM, the most striking is the possibility of a new lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP) chi_{St}^0 which is mostly composed of Stueckelberg fermions. In\nthis scenario the LSP of the MSSM chi_1^0 is unstable and decays into\nchi_{St}^0.

The decompactification limit of noncommutative torus\ninstantons is shown to map in a very precise way, at both the classical and\nquantum level, onto fluxon solutions on the noncommutative plane. The\nweak-coupling singularities of the usual Gross-Taylor string partition function\nfor QCD on the torus are studied in the instanton representation and its double\nscaling limit, appropriate for the mapping onto noncommutative gauge theory, is\nshown to be a generating function for the volumes of the principal moduli\nspaces of holomorphic differentials. The noncommutative deformation of this\nmoduli space geometry is described and appropriate open string interpretations\nare proposed in terms of the fluxon expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2004 17:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This appears to be true whether one considers velocity increments\nthemselves or their absolute values. However, moments of order lower than 2 of\nthe absolute values of velocity increments have not been investigated\nthoroughly for anomaly. Here, we discuss the importance of the scaling of\nnon-integer moments of order between +2 and -1, and obtain them from direct\nnumerical simulations at moderate Reynolds numbers (Taylor microscale Reynolds\nnumbers $R_\\lambda \\le$ 450) and experimental data at high Reynolds numbers\n($R_\\lambda \\approx$ 10,000). The relative difference between the measured\nexponents and Kolmogorov's prediction increases as the moment order decreases\ntowards -1, thus showing that the anomaly that is manifest in high-order\nmoments is present in low-order moments as well. This conclusion provides a\nmotivation for seeking a theory of anomalous scaling as the order of the moment\nvanishes. Such a theory does not have to consider rare events--which may be\naffected by non-universal features such as shear--and so may be regarded as\nadvantageous to consider and develop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2004 22:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmultivariate correlations of the joint scores were analysed using principal\ncomponents analysis.\n  Results: The principal components were well-approximated by the sums and\ndifferences of the SQ and EQ scores. The differences in the scores corresponded\nto sex differences within the control group and also separated out the AS/HFA\ngroup, which showed stronger systemizing than the control group, but\nbelow-average empathy. The sums of the scores did not show sex differences, but\ndid distinguish the AS/HFA group.\n  Conclusions: These tests reliably sex the brain, and their correlations show\nthat empathizing and systemizing are not independent, but compete neurally.\nTheir combined score (EQ + SQ) quantifies the deficit in autism spectrum\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2004 02:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
