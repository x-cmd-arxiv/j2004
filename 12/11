The principal\ncomponents of the variation in the PSF pattern from multiple exposures are used\nto solve for better fits for each individual exposure. These improved fits are\nthen used to correct the weak lensing shapes. Since we expect some degree of\ncorrelation in the PSF anisotropy across exposures, using information from\nstars in all exposures leads to a significant gain in the accuracy of the\nestimated PSF. It means that in general, the accuracy of PSF reconstruction is\nlimited not by the number density of stars per exposure, but by the stacked\nnumber density across all exposures in a given survey. This technique is\napplied to the 75 square degree CTIO lensing survey, and we find that the PSF\nvariation is well described by a small number of components. There is a\nsignificant improvement in the lensing measurements: the residual stellar PSF\ncorrelations are reduced by several orders of magnitude, and the measured\nB-mode in the two-point correlation is consistent with zero down to 1\narcminute. We also discuss the applications of the PCA technique to future\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2004 20:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 2004 20:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We give here an overview of the prominent aspect\nof the polarization of the light delivered by a bending magnet, and some\ndichroic properties in X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). We report then two\nstudies developed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS),\nexemplifying the profit gained using linear and circular polarization of the\nX-ray for the study of magnetic thin films and multilayers. Angle-resolved XAS\nwas used in strained manganite thin films to certify a model of local\ndistortion limited within the $MnO_{6}$ polyhedron. A pioneer experience of\nX-ray magnetic scattering at grazing incidence associated with dispersive XAS\nin a $Co/Gd$ multilayer draws new perspectives for magnetic studies in thin\nfilms and multilayers in atmospheric conditions in the hard X-ray range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2004 17:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Resumming the perturbation theory for a\nweak, short-range interaction and accounting for a finite curvature of the\nfermion spectrum, we eliminate the singularities and obtain the results for the\nquasi-particle self-energy and the spectral function to all orders in the\ninteraction with the zero-sound mode.

It turns out that although\nthe interaction with the collective mode results in an enhancement of the\nfermion self-energy, this interaction does not affect the non-analytic term in\n$C(T)$ due to a subtle cancellation between the contributions from the real and\nimaginary parts of the self-energy.
