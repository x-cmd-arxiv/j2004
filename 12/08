I consider the case of weak anisotropy\n(slight a-symmetry between the two Ising layers) and weak coupling. I show that\nthe system admits two critical temperatures whose difference varies\ncontinuously with the strength of the coupling, scaling with an anomalous\nexponent as one let the a-symmetry parameter go to zero. The specific heat\ndiverges logarithmically at the critical points (as for Ising) but the constant\nin front of the logarithm is renormalized by an anomalous critical exponent.\nThe logarithmic divergence of the specific heat dominates only in an\nexponentially small interval around the critical temperatures and outside it is\nmodified into an anomalous power law behaviour. The proof is based on an exact\nmapping of Ashkin-Teller into a model of (1+1)D interacting fermions and on the\nimplementation of constructive Renormalization group methods on the fermionic\nsystem.

Motivated by the eventual need to go beyond the\nadiabatic approximation we must view the problem as the dynamics of the binary\nunder conservative post-Newtonian forces and gravitational radiation damping.\n  From the viewpoint of the dynamics of the binary, the standard approximation\nat leading order is equivalent to retaining the 0PN and 2.5PN terms in the\nacceleration and neglecting the intervening 1PN and 2PN terms. A complete\nmathematically consistent treatment of the acceleration at leading order should\ninclude all PN terms up to 2.5PN without any gaps. These define the 'standard'\nand 'complete' non-adiabatic approximants respectively. We propose a new and\nsimple complete adiabatic approximant constructed from the energy and flux\nfunctions. At the leading order it uses the 2PN energy function rather than the\n0PN one in the standard approximation so that in spirit it corresponds to the\ndynamics where there are no missing post-Newtonian terms in the acceleration.\nWe compare the overlaps of the standard and complete adiabatic approximants\nwith the exact waveforms for a test-particle orbiting a Schwarzschild black\nhole. The complete adiabatic approximants lead to a remarkable improvement in\nthe effectualness at lower PN (< 3PN) orders.

A basic feature of the multilevel encoding formalism is\nthe logical equivalence of different physical states and correspondingly, of\ndifferent physical transformations. This logical equivalence is a source of a\nsignificant flexibility in designing logical operations, while the multilevel\nstructure inherently accommodates fast and intense broadband controls thereby\nfacilitating faster quantum operations. Another important practical advantage\nof multilevel encoding is the ability to maintain full quantum-computational\nfidelity in the presence of mixing and decoherence within encoding subspaces.\nThe formalism is developed in detail for single-qubit operations and\ngeneralized for multiple qubits.

We show how this entanglement sharing behavior may be studied in\nincreasingly complex systems of both theoretical and experimental significance\nand demonstrate that entanglement sharing, as well as other unique features of\nentanglement, e.g. the fact that maximal information about a multipartite\nquantum system does not necessarily entail maximal information about its\ncomponent subsystems, may be understood as specific consequences of the\nphenomenon of complementarity extended to composite quantum systems.

The success of our simulation\nprovides strong evidence that the power of quantum computation arises not\ndirectly from entanglement, but rather from the nonexistence of an efficient,\nlocal realistic description of the computation, even when augmented by an\nefficient amount of nonlocal, but classical communication.

It is emphasized that the everyday notion of\ninformation is to be firmly distinguished from the technical notions arising in\ninformation theory; however it is maintained that in both settings\n`information' functions as an abstract noun, hence does not refer to a\nparticular or substance (the worth of this point is illustrated in application\nto quantum teleportation). The claim that `Information is Physical' is assessed\nand argued to face a destructive dilemma. Accordingly, the slogan may not be\nunderstood as an ontological claim, but at best, as a methodological one. The\nreflections of Bruckner and Zeilinger (2001) and Deutsch and Hayden (2000) on\nthe nature of information in quantum mechanics are critically assessed and some\nresults presented on the characterization of entanglement in the Deutsch-Hayden\nformalism. Some philosophical aspects of quantum computation are discussed and\ngeneral morals drawn concerning the nature of quantum information theory.\n  In Part II, following some preliminary remarks, two particular\ninformation-theoretic approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics are\nassessed in detail. It is argued that Zeilinger's (1999) Foundational Principle\nis unsuccessful as a foundational principle for quantum mechanics. The\ninformation-theoretic characterization theorem of Clifton, Bub and Halvorson\n(2003) is assessed more favourably, but the generality of the approach is\nquestioned and it is argued that the implications of the theorem for the\ntraditional foundational problems in quantum mechanics remains obscure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 13:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
