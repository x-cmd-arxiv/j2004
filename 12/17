The HINSA follows the\ndistribution of the emission of the carbon monoxide isotopologues, and has a\ncharacteristic size close to that of 13CO. This confirms that the HINSA is\nproduced by cold HI which is well mixed with molecular gas in well-shielded\nregions. The ratio of the atomic hydrogen density to total proton density for\nthese sources is 5 to 27 x 10^{-4}. Using cloud temperatures and the density of\nHI, we set an upper limit to the cosmic ray ionization rate of 10^{-16} s^{-1}.\nComparison of observed and modeled fractional HI abundances indicates ages for\nthese clouds to be 10^{6.5} to 10^{7} yr. The low values of the HI density we\nhave determined make it certain that the time scale for evolution from an\natomic to an almost entirely molecular phase, must be a minimum of several\nmillion years.

The model is an\nextension of an earlier one, with an improved treatment of the cooling of\nrelativistic electrons. This improvement limits the synchrotron-emitting volume\nto a series of fairly narrow layers behind the shocks. We show that the width\nof these layers increases with increasing wavelength, which has important\nconsequences for the shape of the spectrum. We also show that the strongest\nshocks produce the bulk of the emission, so that the emergent radio flux can be\nadequately described as coming from a small number of shocks, or even from a\nsingle shock.\n  A single shock model is completely determined by four parameters: the\nposition of the shock, the compression ratio and velocity jump of the shock,\nand the surface magnetic field. Applying a single shock model to the O5 If star\nCyg OB2 No. 9 allows a good determination of the compression ratio and shock\nposition and, to a lesser extent, the magnetic field and velocity jump.\n  Our main conclusion is that strong shocks need to survive out to distances of\na few hundred stellar radii.

A viable mechanism for the emission of\ngamma$-rays in these sources is the decay of neutral pions created in\ncollisions between the relativistic hadrons and protons in the ambient medium.\nBut neutral pion decay alone cannot reproduce the whole high-energy spectrum,\nparticularly below 100 MeV. A pion-decay scenario thus requires a lepton\npopulation to \"fill in\" the lower part of the spectrum via bremsstrahlung\nemission. This population, however, is constrained by the SNR radio spectrum.\nTaking our cue from the behavior of Sgr A East, an energetic EGRET SNR at the\nGalactic center, we here examine the role played in these sources by secondary\nleptons--electrons and positrons produced in proton-proton scattering events\nand the ensuing particle cascades. We show that while secondary leptons cannot\naccount for the gamma-rays below 100 MeV, they can account for the hard radio\nspectra observed from the EGRET SNR's. Thus, it appears that both primary and\nsecondary leptons may be important contributors to the overall broadband\nemission from these sources, but if so, must radiate most of their energy in\ndifferent parts of the SNR-cloud environment. We show that shock acceleration\nin dense cores being overtaken by the expanding SNR shell can naturally lead to\nsuch a scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 13:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A promising possibility to\nexplain giant radio halos is given by the presence of relativistic electrons\nreaccelerated by some kind of turbulence generated in the cluster volume during\nmerger events. With the aim to investigate the connection between thermal and\nnon-thermal properties of the ICM, in this paper we develope a statistical\nmagneto-turbulent model which describes in a self-consistent way the evolution\nof the thermal ICM and that of the non-thermal emission from clusters. Making\nuse of the extended Press & Schechter formalism, we follow cluster mergers and\nestimate the injection rate of the fluid turbulence generated during these\nenergetic events. We then calculate the evolution of the spectrum of the\nrelativistic electrons in the ICM during the cluster life by taking into\naccount both the electron-acceleration due to the merger-driven turbulence and\nthe relevant energy losses of the electrons. We end up with a synthetic\npopulation of galaxy clusters for which the evolution of the ICM and of the\nnon-thermal spectrum emitted by the accelerated electrons is calculated. The\ngeneration of detectable non-thermal radio and hard X-ray emission in the\nsimulated clusters is found to be possible during major merger events for\nreliable values of the model parameters. In addition the occurrence of radio\nhalos as a function of the mass of the parent clusters is calculated and\ncompared with observations. In this case it is found that the model\nexpectations are in good agreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 14:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The diffusion rates along\nstraight (with close-packed edges) steps with (100) and (111)-type microfacets\n(resp. step A and step B) are first investigated using the transition state\ntheory in the harmonic approximation. It is found that the classical limit\nbeyond which the diffusion rates follow an Arrhenius law is reached above the\nDebye temperature. The Vineyard attempt frequencies and the (static) energy\nbarriers are reported. Then a comparison is made with the results of more\nrealistic classical molecular dynamic simulations which also exhibit an\nArrhenius-like behavior. It is concluded that the corresponding energy barriers\nare completely consistent with the static ones within the statistical errors\nand that the diffusion barrier along step B is significantly larger than along\nstep A. In contrast the prefactors are very different from the Vineyard\nfrequencies. They increase with the static energy barrier in agreement with the\nMeyer-Neldel compensation rule and this increase is well approximated by the\nlaw proposed by Boisvert {\\it et al.} [Phys. Rev.

Our framework uses a number of reusable\napplication-independent components, in order to reduce the effort of creating a\nnatural language interface for a given application. Using a type-logical\ngrammar, we first translate natural language sentences into expressions in an\nextended higher-order logic. These expressions can be seen as executable\nspecifications corresponding to the original sentences. The executable\nspecifications are then interpreted by invoking appropriate procedures provided\nby the application for which a natural language interface is being created.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 03:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We generalize\nthese results to $n_T=2^n$ transmit and an arbitrary number of receive antennas\n$n_R$. Furthermore, we completely characterize the structure of the equivalent\nchannel for the general case and show that for all $n_T=2^n$ and $n_R$ the\neigenvectors of the equivalent channel are fixed and independent from the\nchannel realization. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of the equivalent channel are\nindependent identically distributed random variables each following a\nnoncentral chi-square distribution with $4n_R$ degrees of freedom.\n  Based on these important insights into the structure of the QSTBC, we derive\nan analytical lower bound for the fraction of outage probability achieved with\nQSTBC and show that this bound is tight for low signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)\nvalues and also for increasing number of receive antennas.

Energy and spatial\nshifts in projection sampling with respect to projector sampling were also\nintroduced to test F3DMC in realistic conditions. Experiments with the cubic\nphantom showed the importance of using simulations with high statistics for\ncalculating the projector, and the value of filtering the projector using a PCA\napproach.
