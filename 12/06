We find that, even if only the very basic -- and well understood\n-- coagulation mechanisms are included, the process of grain growth is much too\nquick to be consistent with infrared observations of T Tauri disks. Small\ngrains are removed so efficiently that, long before the disk reaches an age of\n1E6 years typical of T Tauri stars, the SED shows only very weak infrared\nexcess. This is inconsistent with observed SEDs of most classical T Tauri\nstars. Small grains somehow need to be replenished, for instance by aggregate\nfragmentation through high-speed collisions. A very simplified calculation\nshows that when aggregate fragmentation is included, a quasi-stationary grain\nsize distribution is obtained in which growth and fragmentation are in\nequilibrium. This quasi-stationary state may last 1E6 years or even longer,\ndependent on the circumstances in the disk, and may bring the time scales into\nthe right regime.

It is\nargued that the precise values of the Drude parameters are crucial for accurate\nevaluation of the force. The dielectric function of perfect single crystalline\ngold is discussed. It is used to establish the upper limit on the absolute\nvalue of the force. It is demonstrated that the force between films is smaller\nthan that between bulk samples mainly due to the presence of voids and electron\nscattering on the grain boundaries in the films. The minimal reduction of the\nforce is estimated as 2% for the smallest separations investigated in the most\nprecise experiments. The other sample effects can reduce the force further but\nthe correction is expected to be smaller than 1%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 10:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\ngeneralize our scheme to higher dimensions and show that one can communicate\n2log_2 d classical bits by sending a d-dimensional quantum state with a certain\nprobability of success. The success probability in super dense coding is\nrelated to the success probability of distinguishing non-orthogonal states. The\noptimal average success probabilities are explicitly calculated. We consider\nthe possibility of sending 2 log_2 d classical bits with a shared resource of a\nhigher dimensional entangled state (D X D, D > d). It is found that more\nentanglement does not necessarily lead to higher success probability. This also\nanswers the question as to why we need log_2 d ebits to send 2 log_2 d\nclassical bits in a deterministic fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 10:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2005 15:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}
