The limitation on the classical\ncomputational resources gives the unified description of quantum dynamics that\nis not divided to the unitary dynamics and measurements and does not depend on\nthe existence of observer. It is proposed the description of states based on\nthe nesting of particles in each other that permits to account the effects of\nall levels in the same model. Algorithmic approach admits the possibility of\nrefutation, because it forbids the creation of a scalable quantum computer that\nis allowed in the conventional quantum formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2004 14:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
