Cases with and\nwithout self sustained MHD turbulence are considered. The conditions for gap\nformation and the transition from type I migration are investigated and found\nto depend on whether the single parameter M_p R^3/(M_* H^3), with M_p, M_*, R\nand H being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the orbital radius and the\ndisk semi-thickness respectively exceeds a number of order unity. We also\ninvestigate the coorbital torques experienced by a moving protoplanet in an\ninviscid disk. This is done by demonstrating the equivalence of the problem for\na moving protoplanet to one where the protoplanet is in a fixed orbit which the\ndisk material flows through radially as a result of the action of an\nappropriate external torque. For sustainable coorbital torques to be realized a\nquasi steady state must be realized in which the planet migrates through the\ndisk without accreting significant mass. In that case although there is\nsensitivity to computational parameters, in agreement with earlier work by\nMasset & Papaloizou (2003) based on global simulations, the coorbital torques\nare proportional to the migration speed and result in a positive feedback on\nthe migration, enhancing it and potentially leading to a runaway.

A typical result of {\\it cooperation} is the formation of stable\nbridges, signatures of spatiotemporal inhomogeneities; we review their\ngeometrical characteristics and compare theoretical results with those of\nindependent simulations. {\\it Cooperative} excitations due to local density\nfluctuations are also responsible for relaxation at the angle of repose; the\n{\\it competition} between these fluctuations and external driving forces, can,\non the other hand, result in a (rare) collapse of the sandpile to the\nhorizontal. Both these features are present in a theory reviewed here. An arena\nwhere the effects of cooperation versus competition are felt most keenly is\ngranular compaction; we review here a random graph model, where three-spin\ninteractions are used to model compaction under tapping. The compaction curve\nshows distinct regions where 'fast' and 'slow' dynamics apply, separated by\nwhat we have called the {\\it single-particle relaxation threshold}. In the\nfinal section of this paper, we explore the effect of shape -- jagged vs.\nregular -- on the compaction of packings near their jamming limit. One of our\nmajor results is an entropic landscape that, while microscopically rough,\nmanifests {\\it Edwards' flatness} at a macroscopic level. Another major result\nis that of surface intermittency under low-intensity shaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2004 09:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2005 11:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We discuss its recent developments on both theoretical and\nexperimental fronts.We describe and analyze several experimental investigations\nrelated to the temperature effects on the structure, electronic spectra,or bond\nrupture forces for molecules. This includes the study of the temperature impact\non the pathway shifts for the protein unfolding by atomic force microscopy, the\ntemperature dependence of the absorption spectra of electrons in solvents, and\ntemperature influence over the intermolecular forces measured by the AFM. On\nthe theoretical side, we review a recent advancement made by the author in the\ncoming fields of quantum chemistry at finite temperature. Starting from Bloch\nequation, we have derived the sets of hierarchy equations for the reduced\ndensity operators in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. They provide\na law according to which the reduced density operators vary in temperature for\nthe identical and interacting many-body particles. By taking the independent\nparticle approximation, we have solved the equation in the case of a grand\ncanonical ensemble, and obtained an eigenequation for the molecular orbitals at\nfinite temperature. The explicit expression for the temperature-dependent Fock\noperator is also given. They will form a foundation for the study of the\nmolecular electronic structures and their interplay with the finite\ntemperature. Furthermore, we clarify the physics concerning the temperature\neffect on the electronic structure or processes of molecules which is crucial\nfor both theoretical understanding and computational study.Finally,we summarize\nour discussion and point out the theoretical and computational issues for the\nfuture explorations in the fields of quantum chemistry at finite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2004 02:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2005 00:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmicrolaser is found to display multiple thresholds analogous to first-order\nphase transitions of the cavity field. Hysteresis is observed as a function of\natom-cavity detuning and number of atoms. Data is compared with a rate equation\nmodel and fully quantized treatment based on micromaser theory. Good agreement\nbetween theory and experiment is found when the cavity is resonant with atoms\nof the most probable velocity, but long lifetimes of metastable states preclude\nthe observation of true steady-state transition points. For nonzero atom-cavity\ndetuning the microlaser displays broadenings and shifts which are not yet\nwell-understood. Quantum trajectory simulations are performed to investigate\nmany-atom and finite transit time effects in the microlaser.
