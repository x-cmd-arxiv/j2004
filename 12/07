Our AU\nMic observations thus offer the possibility to probe at high spatial resolution\n(0.04\" or 0.4 AU per resolution element) for morphological signatures of the\ndebris disk on Solar-System scales. Various sub-structures (dust clumps and\ngaps) in the AU Mic disk may point to the existence of orbiting planets. No\nplanets are seen in our H-band image down to a limiting mass of 1 M_Jup at >20\nAU, although the existence of smaller planets can not be excluded from the\ncurrent data. Modeling of the disk surface brightness distribution at H-band\nand R-band, in conjunction with the optical to sub-millimeter spectral energy\ndistribution, allows us to constrain the disk geometry and the dust grain\nproperties. We confirm the nearly edge-on orientation of the disk inferred from\nprevious observations, and deduce an inner clearing radius <=10 AU. We find\nevidence for a lack of small grains in the inner (<60 AU) disk, either as a\nresult of primordial disk evolution, or because of destruction by\nPoynting-Robertson and/or corpuscular drag. A change in the power-law index of\nthe surface brightness profile is observed near 33 AU, similar to a feature\nknown in the profile of the beta Pic circumstellar debris disk. By comparing\nthe time scales for inter-particle collisions and Poynting-Robertson drag\nbetween the two systems, we argue that the breaks are linked to one of these\ntwo processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 21:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The central\nfeature of the kick mechanism is a radiative-driven magnetoacoustic\ninstability, which we refer to as ``neutrino bubbles.'' Identical in nature to\nthe photon bubble instability, the neutrino bubble instability requires the\npresence of an equilibrium radiative flux as well as a coherent steady\nbackground magnetic field. Over regions of large magnetic flux densities, the\nneutrino bubble instability is allowed to grow on dynamical timescales ~ 1ms,\npotentially leading to large luminosity enhancements and density fluctuations.\nLocal luminosity enhancements, which preferentially occur over regions of\nstrong magnetic field, lead to a net global asymmetry in the neutrino emission\nand the young neutron star is propelled in the direction opposite to these\nregions.

We combine these stars' radial\nvelocities with other literature studies in search of binarity. The search\nreveals that four of our CEMP-s stars (44%) are in binary systems. Using the\nanalysis of Lucatello et al. (2004), we find that all the CEMP-s stars in our\nsample are binaries. This conclusion implies that CEMP-s stars may be the very\nmetal-poor relatives of CH and Ba II stars, which are believed to have acquired\ntheir peculiar abundance patterns by mass transfer from a thermally-pulsing AGB\ncompanion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2004 13:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Neural networks have proved to be versatile\nand robust in multi-dimensional data classification. In this article we shall\nstudy the classification of gamma from the hadrons for the MAGIC Experiment.\nTwo neural networks have been used for the classification task. One is\nMulti-Layer Perceptron based on supervised learning and other is\nSelf-Organising Map (SOM), which is based on unsupervised learning technique.\nThe results have been shown and the possible ways of combining these networks\nhave been proposed to yield better and faster classification results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 20:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

LRA has potential applications in many areas,\nincluding information extraction, word sense disambiguation, machine\ntranslation, and information retrieval. Relational similarity is correspondence\nbetween relations, in contrast with attributional similarity, which is\ncorrespondence between attributes. When two words have a high degree of\nattributional similarity, we call them synonyms. When two pairs of words have a\nhigh degree of relational similarity, we say that their relations are\nanalogous. For example, the word pair mason/stone is analogous to the pair\ncarpenter/wood. Past work on semantic similarity measures has mainly been\nconcerned with attributional similarity. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM)\nof information retrieval has been adapted to the task of measuring relational\nsimilarity, achieving a score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level\nmultiple-choice word analogy questions. In the VSM approach, the relation\nbetween a pair of words is characterized by a vector of frequencies of\npredefined patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three\nways: (1) the patterns are derived automatically from the corpus (they are not\npredefined), (2) the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to smooth the\nfrequency data (it is also used this way in Latent Semantic Analysis), and (3)\nautomatically generated synonyms are used to explore reformulations of the word\npairs. LRA achieves 56% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent\nto the average human score of 57%. On the related problem of classifying\nnoun-modifier relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM, while using a\nsmaller corpus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2004 21:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We emphasize the importance of the flow excitation function from\n1 to 50 A$\\cdot$GeV: here the hydrodynamic model has predicted the collapse of\nthe $v_1$-flow and of the $v_2$-flow at $\\sim 10$ A$\\cdot$GeV; at 40\nA$\\cdot$GeV it has been recently observed by the NA49 collaboration. Since\nhadronic rescattering models predict much larger flow than observed at this\nenergy we interpret this observation as evidence for a first order phase\ntransition at high baryon density $\\rho_B$.
