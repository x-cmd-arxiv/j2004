Our implementation of this method uses the Bruzual &\nCharlot (2003) models and observed spectra in the 3650--8000 \\AA range. The\nreliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1)\nsimulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique,\nand (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of\ngalaxies from the SDSS.

Scintillation can cause independent\nvariations between closely-spaced spectral lines, and can even alter the line\nprofile. The background source need not be compact to exhibit spectral\nvariability. The variability can be used to infer the parsec to sub-parsec\nscale structure of the intervening absorbing material. We discuss the\nimportance of scintillation relative to other possible origins of spectral\nvariability. The present theory is applied to account for the variations\nobserved in the HI-absorbed quasar PKS 1127-145.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 22:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These\nobservations were carried out to test the bowshock hypothesis presented by\nTanner et al. as an alternative to a very recent (10^4 yr) epoch of star\nformation within the tidal stream of gas and dust known as the Northern Arm.\nResolved asymmetric structure is detected in all the sources, with bowshock\nmorphologies associated with IRS 1W, 5, 8 and 10W. For IRS 1W and 10W, there is\nan agreement between the position angle of the asymmetry and that of the\nrelative velocity vector of the near-infrared source with respect to the\nNorthern Arm gas strengthening the bowshock hypothesis. We therefore conclude\nthat the observed morphology is indeed a bowshock generated by sources plowing\nthrough the Northern Arm. Furthermore, the large extent of the resolved\nstructures (310-1340 AU) along with their luminosities (~10^4-5 Lsun) suggests\nthat their central sources are Wolf-Rayet stars, comparable to the broad He\nemission-line stars, which have strong winds on the order of 1000 km/s. The\nbowshock morphology, along with the proper motion measurements, provide\nthree-dimensional orbital solutions for this enigmatic class of objects; IRS 1W\nand 10W have orbital planes that are consistent with that of the putative\nclockwise plane which has been proposed as a solution for the He I\nemission-line stars. While these observations eliminate the need to invoke star\nformation within the Northern Arm, they increase by 14% the total known\npopulation of massive, young stars with strong winds, whose origin remains\nunexplained in the context of the nearby supermassive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 21:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A high effective temperature is consistent with the expectation\nthat dwarf nova systems that show standstills, as Z Cam does, have higher than\nnormal time-averaged mass accretion rates.

A white dwarf model in which 29%\nof the surface has a temperature of 72,000 K and the rest of the surface is at\n26,000 K also reproduces the spectral shape and the continuum flux level at the\nnominal distance and WD mass, and is a somewhat better statistical fit to the\ndata.

Let P_c(b)\nbe the probability that DPLL backtracks b times.

Then we show that even in the\n``easy'' phase 1 < c < c^* where P_c(0) > 0, including just above the emergence\nof the giant component, the expected number of backtracks is exponentially\nlarge with positive probability.

In fact, the definition of noise depends largely on our own aim in the\nwhole image analysis process, and (perhaps more important) in our\nself-perception of noise. For instance, when we perceive noise as disconnected\nand small it is normal to use MM-ASF filters to treat it. There is two\nevidences of this. First, in many instances there is no ideal and pure\nnoise-free image to compare our filtering process (nothing but our\nself-perception of its pure image); second, and related with this first point,\nMM transformations that we chose are only based on our self - and perhaps -\nfuzzy notion. The present proposal combines the results of two MM filtering\ntransformations (FT1, FT2) and makes use of some measures and quantitative\nrelations on their Size/Intensity Diagrams to find the most appropriate noise\nremoval process. Results can also be used for finding the most appropriate stop\ncriteria, and the right sequence of MM operators combination on Alternating\nSequential Filters (ASF), if these measures are applied, for instance, on a\nGenetic Algorithm's target function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2004 18:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To illustrate the idea, we focus on the closed fermionic\nsu(1|1) sector of the N=4 gauge theory. We introduce a new technique, the\nperturbative asymptotic Bethe ansatz, and use it to extract this sector's\nthree-loop S-matrix from Beisert's involved algebraic work on the three-loop\nsu(2|3) sector.

In the classical case, a theorem of\nDixmier asserts that the simple factor algebras of the positive part U^+(g) of\nthe enveloping algebra of g, whose Gelfand-Kirillov dimension is equal to 2,\nare isomorphic to the first Weyl algebra. In order to obtain some new quantized\nanalogues of the first Weyl algebra, we explicitly describe the prime and\nprimitive spectra of the positive part U_q^+(g) of the quantized enveloping\nalgebra of g and then we study the simple factor algebras of U_q^+(g) whose\nGelfand-Kirillov dimension is equal to 2. In particular, we show that the\ncenters of such simple factor algebras are reduced to the ground field C and we\ncompute their group of invertible elements. These computations suggest that we\ndistinguish between two families of such simple factor algebras of U_q^+(g).\nThe first family consists of those simple factor algebras whose group of units\nis non-trivial; algebras in this first family are the so-called Weyl-Hayashi\nalgebras and turn out to be examples of generalized Weyl algebras over a\nLaurent polynomial ring in one indeterminate. In contrast, the second family\nconsists of those simple factor algebras whose group of units is trivial;\nalgebras in this second class can not be presented as generalized Weyl algebras\nover a (Laurent) polynomial ring in one indeterminate.

The\nsample includes 44 High-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), 14 Low-energy peaked BL\nLacs (LBLs), and 28 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). A total of 168 LECS,\nMECS, and PDS spectra were analyzed, corresponding to observations taken in the\nperiod 1996--2002. The 0.1--50 keV continuum of LBLs and FSRQs is generally\nfitted by a single power law with Galactic column density. A minority of the\nobservations of LBLs (25%) and FSRQs (15%) is best fitted by more complex\nmodels like the broken power law or the continuously curved parabola. These\nlatter models provide also the best description for half of the HBL spectra.\nComplex models are more frequently required for sources with fluxes F_{2-10\nkeV} > 10^-11 cm-2 s-1, corresponding to spectra with higher signal-to-noise\nratio. As a result, considering sources with flux above this threshold, the\npercentage of spectra requiring those models increases for all the classes. We\nnote that there is a net separation of X-ray spectral properties between HBLs\non one side, and LBLs and FSRQs on the other, the distinction between LBLs and\nFSRQs is more blurry.
