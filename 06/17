A prominent (EW ~ 1-2 keV) emission line at ~6.4 keV is\ndetected by both instruments. From the XMM-Newton data alone the line is\nspectrally localized at E ~ 6.42 +/- 0.03 keV, and seems to be spatially\nconcentrated in the nuclear region of NGC 4666. This, together with the\npresence of a flat (Gamma ~ 1.3) continuum in the nuclear region, suggests the\nexistence of a strongly absorbed (i.e., Compton-thick) AGN, whose intrinsic\n2-10 keV luminosity is estimated to be L_{2-10} > 2 x 10^{41} erg/s. At\nenergies <1 keV the integrated (BeppoSAX) spectrum is dominated by a ~0.25 keV\nthermal gas component distributed throughout the disk (resolved by XMM-Newton).\nAt energies ~2-10 keV, the integrated spectrum is dominated by a steep (G > 2)\npower-law (PL) component.

The H2 lines\nare unresolved in all objects in which they were detected while the [FeII]\nlines have widths implying gas velocities of up to 650 km/s. This suggests\nthat, very likely, the H2 and [FeII] emission does not originate from the same\nparcel of gas. Molecular H2 were detected in 90% of the sample, including PG\nobjects, indicating detectavel amounts of molecular material even in objects\nwith low levels of circumnuclear starburst activity. The data favors thermal\nexcitation for the H2 lines. Indeed, in NGC3227, Mrk766, NGC4051 and NGC4151,\nthe molecular emission is found to be purely thermal. This result is also\nconfirmed by the rather similar vibrational and rotational temperatures in the\nobjects for which they were derived. [FeII] lines are detected in all of the\nAGN. The [FeII] 1.254mu/Pa-beta ratio is compatible with excitation of the\n[FeII] by the active nucleus, but in Mrk 766 it implies a stellar origin. A\ncorrelation between H2/Br-gamma and [FeII]/Pa-beta is found. We confirm that it\nis a useful diagnostic tool in the NIR to separate emitting line objects by\ntheir level of nuclear activity. X-ray excitation models are able to explain\nthe observed H2 and part of the [FeII] emission. Most likely, a combination of\nX-ray heating, shocks driven by the radio jet, and circumnuclear star formation\ncontributes, in different proportions, to the H2 and [FeII] emission. In most\nof our spectra, the [FeII] 1.257mu/1.644mu ratio is found to be 30% lower than\nthe intrinsic value based on current atomic data. This implies either than the\nextinction towards the [FeII] emitting clouds is very similar in most objects\nor there are possible inaccuracies in the A-values in the [FeII] transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 15:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A lot of information on this process has\nbeen extracted from remote observations of impact craters on planetary\nsurfaces. However, the nature of the geophysical impact events is that they are\nnon-reproducible. Moreover, their scale is enormous and direct observations are\nnot possible. Therefore, we choose an alternate and of course downscaled\nexperimental approach in order to guarantee reproducible results: We prepare\nvery fine sand in a well defined and fully decompactified state by letting gas\nbubble through it. After turning off the gas stream, we let a steel ball fall\non the sand. The series of events in the experiments and corresponding discrete\nparticle simulations is as follows: On impact of the ball, sand is blown away\nin all directions (\"splash\") and an impact crater forms. When this cavity\ncollapses, a granular jet emerges and is driven straight into the air. A second\njet goes downwards into the air bubble entrained during the process, thus\npushing surface material deep into the ground. The air bubble rises slowly\ntowards the surface, causing a granular eruption. In addition to the\nexperiments and the discrete particle simulations we present a simple continuum\ntheory to account for the void collapse leading to the formation of the upward\nand downward jets. We show that the phenomenon is robust and even works for\noblique impacts: the upward jet is then shooting backwards, in the direction\nwhere the projectile came from.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 19:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study the case when a small dune bumps into a bigger one.\nRecently Schwammle et al. and Katsuki et al. have shown that under certain\ncircumstances dunes can behave like solitary waves. This means that they can\n``cross'' each other which has been questioned by many researchers before. In\nother cases we observe coalescence, i.e. both dune merge into one, breeding,\ni.e. the creation of three baby dunes at the center and horns of a Barchan, or\nbudding, i.e. the small dune, after ``crossing'' the big one, is unstable and\nsplits into two new dunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 10:12:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 07:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The implementation uses the\nstandard, publicly available Charniak (2000) parser as input, and generates a\nlist of anaphora-antecedent pairs as output. Alternately, an in-place\nannotation or substitution of the anaphors with their antecedents can be\nproduced. Evaluation on the MUC-6 co-reference task shows that JavaRAP has an\naccuracy of 57.9%, similar to the performance given previously in the\nliterature (e.g., Preiss 2002).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 12:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a result, CP\nviolation in the $B$ system allows one not only to detect the presence of new\nphysics (NP), but also to measure its parameters. This will allow a partial\nidentification of the NP, before its production at high-energy colliders. In\nthis paper, we examine three methods for measuring NP parameters. The first\nuses a technique involving both $\\btos$ and $\\btod$ penguin B decays. Depending\non which pair of decays is used, the theoretical error is in the range 5--15%.\nThe second involves a comparison of $B\\to \\pi K$ and $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays.\nAlthough the theoretical error is large ($\\gsim 25%$), the method can be\nperformed now, with presently-available data. The third is via a time-dependent\nangular analysis of $\\bvv$ decays. In this case, there is no theoretical error,\nbut the technique is experimentally challenging, and the method applies only to\nthose NP models whose weak phase is universal to all NP operators. A reliable\nidentification of the NP will involve the measurement of the NP parameters in\nmany different ways, and with as many B decay modes as possible, so that it\nwill be important to use all of these methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 14:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2004 13:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2005 15:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

To\ninvestigate whether this cancellation happens dynamically, and within the\ncontext of a realistic cosmology, we study a codimension-two braneworld with\nspherical extra dimensions compactified by magnetic flux. Assuming Einstein\ngravity, we show that when the brane contains matter with an arbitrary equation\nof state, the 4D metric components are not regular at the brane, unless the\nbrane has nonzero thickness. We construct explicit 6D solutions with thick\nbranes, treating the brane matter as a perturbation, and find that the universe\nexpands consistently with standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology.\nThe relation between the brane tension and the bulk deficit angle becomes\n$\\Delta=2\\pi G_6(\\rho-3 p)$ for a general equation of state. However, this\nrelation does not imply a self-tuning of the effective 4D cosmological constant\nto zero; perturbations of the brane tension in a static solution lead to\ndeSitter or anti-deSitter braneworlds. Our results thus confirm other recent\nwork showing that codimension-two braneworlds in nonsupersymmetric Einstein\ngravity do not lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant, but\nthey leave open the possibility that supersymmetric versions can be compatible\nwith self-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 19:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2004 12:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The formulas for computing the\ncurvature in terms of components of the metric, in isothermal coordinates,\ninvolve the Laplacian operator and therefore, the problem of finding a\nRiemannian metric for a given curvature form may be viewed as a potential\ntheory problem. This problem has, generally speaking, a multitude of solutions.\nTo specify the solution uniquely, we ask that the metric have the mean value\nproperty for harmonic functions with respect to some given point. This means\nthat we assume that the surface is simply connected and that it has a smooth\nboundary. In terms of the so-called metric potential, we are looking for a\nunique smooth solution to a nonlinear fourth order elliptic partial\ndifferential equation with second order Cauchy data given on the boundary. We\nfind a simple condition on the curvature form which ensures that there exists a\nsmooth mean value surface solution. It reads: the curvature form plus half the\ncurvature form for the hyperbolic plane (with the same coordinates) should be\n$\\le0$. The same analysis leads to results on the question of whether the\ncanonical divisors in weighted Bergman spaces over the unit disk have\nextraneous zeros. Numerical work suggests that the above condition on the\ncurvature form is essentially sharp.\n  Our problem is in spirit analogous to the classical Minkowski problem, where\nthe sphere supplies the chart coordinates via the Gauss map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-11"}

This stability is quantified by the fidelity. Dependence of fidelity\non the initial state as well as on the dynamical properties of the system is\nconsidered. In particular, systems having a chaotic or regular classical limit\nare analysed. The fidelity decay rate is given by an integral of the\ncorrelation function of the perturbation and is thus smaller the faster\ncorrelation function decays. If the perturbation can be written as a time\nderivative of another operator, meaning that the time averaged perturbation\nvanishes, fidelity freezes at a constant value and starts to decay only after a\nlong time inversely proportional to the perturbation strength. In composite\nsystems stability of entanglement to perturbations of the Hamiltonian is\nanalysed in terms of purity. For regular systems purity decay is shown to be\nindependent of Planck's constant for coherent initial states in the\nsemiclassical limit. The accelerated decoherence of macroscopic superpositions\nis also explained. The theory of fidelity decay is applied to the stability of\nquantum computation and an improved quantum Fourier transform algorithm is\ndesigned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2004 15:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
