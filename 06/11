The structure of this source is complex\nbut interstellar scattering dominates the structure of the central component at\nleast to 15 GHz. An analysis of the phase structure functions of the\ninterferometric visibilities shows the density fluctuations along this line of\nsight to be anisotropic (axial ratio = 1.3) with a frequency-independent\nposition angle, and having an inner scale of roughly a few hundred kilometers.\nThe anisotropies occur on length scales of order 10^{15} cm (D/5 kpc), which\nwithin the context of certain magnetohydrodynamic turbulence theories indicates\nthe length scale on which the kinetic and magnetic energy densities are\ncomparable. A conservative upper limit on the velocity of the scattering\nmaterial is 1800 km/s. In the 0.33 GHz field of view, there are a number of\nother sources that might also be heavily scattered. Both B1849+005 and PSR\nB1849+00 are highly scattered, and they are separated by only 13'. If the lines\nof sight are affected by the same ``clump'' of scattering material, it must be\nat least 2.3 kpc distant. However, a detailed attempt to account for the\nscattering observables toward these sources does not produce a self-consistent\nset of parameters for such a clump. A clump of H\\alpha emission, possibly\nassociated with the H II region G33.418-0.004, lies between these two lines of\nsight, but it seems unable to account for all of the required excess\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 16:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the first observation, the\nFe XXVI line has a FWHM of 1800 +/- 400 km/s and a blue-shift of 700 +/- 200\nkm/s, suggesting that the highly ionized medium is an outflow. Moreover, the Fe\nXXV line is observed to vary significantly on a timescale of a few hundred\nseconds in the first observation, which corresponds to the Keplerian orbital\nperiod at approximately 1 E+4 gravitational radii. Our models for the\nabsorption geometry suggest that a combination of geometric effects and\nchanging ionizing flux are required to account for the large changes in line\nflux observed between observations, and that the absorption likely occurs at a\nradius less than 1 E+4 radii for a 10 Msun black hole.

The intrinsic alignments are believed to\nbe small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing\ndistortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing\nshear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the\ntidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby\ngalaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant\ngalaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic\nalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to\nthe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as\nsuggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a\ngravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the\nintrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that\nremains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second\nmodel, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation.\nIn the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently\nclaimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the GI correlation\nterm can exceed the usual II term by >1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic\ncorrelation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude.

The first model (I), for post-deposition coarsening\ndynamics, contains mechanisms of diffusion, attachment, and slow activated\ndetachment (at rate epsilon<<1) of particles on a line. Simulation shows three\nsuccessive regimes of cluster growth: fast attachment of isolated particles;\ndetachment allowing further (epsilon t)^(1/3) coarsening of average cluster\nsize; and t^(-1/2) approach to a saturation size going like epsilon^(-1/2).\nModel II generalizes the first one in having an additional mechanism of\nparticle deposition into cluster gaps, suppressed for the smallest gaps.

We use the transfer integral technique to write down\nthe pseudo-Schr\\\"odinger equation for the model, which allows to obtain some\nanalytical insight, and to compute numerically the free energy from the exact\ntransfer operator. We compare the results with Monte Carlo simulations of the\nmodel, finding a perfect agreement between both procedures. We thus establish\nthat the model shows a phase transition between a low temperature flat phase\nand a high temperature rough one. The fact that the model is one dimensional\nand that it has a true phase transition makes it an ideal framework for further\nstudies of roughening phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 22:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2004 14:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Since top quarks are produced in pairs and decay in\nonly ~10^-24 s into various final states, reconstructing their mass from their\ndecay products is very challenging. Here we report a technique that extracts\nfar more information from each top-quark event and yields a greatly improved\nprecision on the top mass of 5.3 GeV/c^2, compared to previous measurements.\nWhen our new result is combined with our published measurement in a\ncomplementary decay mode and with the only other measurements available, the\nnew world average for M_t becomes 178.0 +- 4.3 GeV/c^2. As a result, the most\nlikely Higgs mass increases from the experimentally excluded value of 96\nGeV/c^2 to 117 GeV/c^2, which is beyond current experimental sensitivity. The\nupper limit on the Higgs mass at 95% confidence level is raised from 219\nGeV/c^2 to 251 GeV/c^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2004 06:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

We prove that the entanglement approaches a\nconstant value exponentially fast as the size of the subsystem increases.\nActually we proved that the density matrix of the continuous block of spins\ndepends only on the length of the block, but not on the total size of the chain\n[distance to the ends also not essential]. We also study reduced density\nmatrices of two spins both in the bulk and on the boundary. We evaluated\nconcurrencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 18:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 23:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Sep 2004 15:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
