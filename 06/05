First, multi-periodicity is eliminated for these\npulsations, i.e. they are not caused by the excitation of a small number of\npulsation modes with constant amplitudes. Next, on the basis of energetics we\nalso eliminate stochasticity as a cause, leaving low dimensional chaos as the\nonly alternative. We then use a global flow reconstruction technique in an\nattempt to extract quantitative information from the light curves, and to\nuncover common physical features in this class of irregular variable stars that\nstraddle the RV Tau to the Mira variables. Evidence is presented that the\npulsational behavior of R UMi, RS Cyg, V CVn and UX Dra takes place in a\n4-dimensional dynamical phase space, suggesting that two vibrational modes are\ninvolved in the pulsation. A linear stability analysis of the fixed points of\nthe maps further indicates the existence of a two-mode resonance, similar to\nthe one we had uncovered earlier in R Sct: The irregular pulsations are the\nresult of a continual energy exchange between two strongly nonadiabatic modes,\na lower frequency pulsation mode and an overtone that are in a close 2:1\nresonance. The evidence is particularly convincing for R UMi, RS Cyg and V CVn,\nbut much weaker for UX Dra. In contrast, the pulsations of SX Her appear to be\nmore complex and may require a 6D space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2004 17:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The\nintegration kernel is related with the incident neutron spectrum, the total\ncross section of the filter analyzer and the detectors efficiency function. A\ncomparison of the present formalism with the customarily employed approximation\nbased on a convolution of the momentum distribution with a resolution function\nis presented.

The argument has been mostly\ndiscussed by metaphysicians, though it appeals to ideas from classical\nmechanics, especially about rotation. In contrast, I assess the RDA from the\nperspective of the philosophy of physics.\n  After introducing the argument and emphasizing the relevance of physics\n(Sections 1 to 3), I review some metaphysicians' replies to the argument\n(Section 4). Thereafter, I argue for three main conclusions. They all arise\nfrom the fact, emphasized in Section 2, that classical mechanics\n(non-relativistic as well as relativistic) is both more subtle, and more\nproblematic, than philosophers generally realize.\n  The main conclusion is that the RDA can be defeated (Section 6 onwards).\nNamely, by the perdurantist taking objects in classical mechanics (whether\npoint-particles or continuous bodies) to have only temporally extended, i.e.\nnon-instantaneous, temporal parts: which immediately blocks the RDA.\nAdmittedly, this version of perdurantism defines persistence in a weaker sense\nof `definition' than {\\em pointilliste} versions that aim to define persistence\nassuming only instantaneous temporal parts. But I argue that temporally\nextended temporal parts are supported by both classical and quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2004 16:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
