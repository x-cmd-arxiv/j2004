Paper I starts with acknowledging B. Lindblad,\nrightly regarded the main father of this whole subject, and then describes the\nearly contributions by Lynden-Bell, Toomre, Hunter and Kalnajs, who had\nformulated and applied such notions as the stability of flat galaxies, the\nregenerative spiral phenomenon, the shearing density waves and the global\nspiral modes. But the foremost enthusiast and proponent of the density-wave\npicture was undoubtedly C.C. Lin whose 1964 and 1966 papers with Shu, written\nin support of his working hypothesis of the quasi-stationary wave-mode spiral\nstructure, had a big and immediate impact upon astronomers, at least as a\nwelcome sign that genuine understanding of the spiral phenomenon seemed in some\nsense to be just around the corner.\n  We find that even Lin occasionally let himself get carried away with too much\nenthusiasm as for instance when he wrote that his relatively exploratory work\nwith Shu had already led to a \"theory free from the kinematical difficulty of\ndifferential rotation\", or that it \"enables us to provide a mechanism to\nexplain the existence of a spiral pattern over the whole disk while allowing\nthe individual spiral arms to be broken and fragmentary\" (Lin 1967b, p.462).\nAlready at the time such optimism was not entirely shared by other experts, and\nby the late 1960s - as we shall see in Paper II - it had become very clear to\neveryone that much hard work still remained to explain even the persistence,\nmuch less the dynamical origins, of the variety of spirals that we observe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2004 18:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nsemiempirical theory by Lin and Shu was confronted with serious problems. They\nwere put on the defensive over their tightly wrapped steady modes on two\nprincipal fronts: from the radial propagation at the group velocity that would\ntend to wind them almost at the material rate, and from the tendencies of\ngalaxy disks toward a strong global instability that appeared likely to\noverwhelm them. Of course, one might claim that such threats were imaginary and\nonly of academic interest, on the ground that nature itself had overcome them.\nOne might also be confident that the QSSS hypothesis must be correct as\nilluminated by the everlasting truth of Hubble's classification. One might even\ntake pride in the fact that a very promising concept developed, although not\nconnected to the wave steadiness, on spiral shocks in interstellar gas and\ntheir induced star formation. But such a heuristic approach did not stimulate\nvery strong progress in understanding dynamical principles of the spiral\nphenomenon; moreover, it often misled, and a rich irony was already that the\nsupposed QSSS favorites M51 and M81 turned out most probably not to be\nquasi-steady at all. A further irony was the continuing failure of Lin and Shu\nto account the trailing character of their 'modes', while that was already\ngrasped by their direct 'deductive' opponents. But the greatest irony lay in\nthe fact that the concept later known as swing amplification, worked out by the\nmid-1960s, was originally denigrated by Lin's camp as relating exclusively to\n'material arms', whereas it turned out in the end to be of vital importance to\nthis entire spiral enterprise including the variants of chaotic ragged\npatterns, tidal transient grand designs and growing or quasi-steady modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2004 18:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Red giant candidates were targeted in a small field on M31's giant\nsouthern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31kpc from the galaxy center.\nWe isolate a clean sample of 68 giants by removing contaminants (foreground\nGalactic dwarfs and background galaxies) using spectroscopic, imaging, and\nphotometric methods.

We use the mass profile we determined from the\ndistribution and kinematics of the early-type galaxies (i.e. ellipticals,\nexcluding the brightest ones, and S0s) outside substructures; the latter were\nassumed to be on isotropic orbits, which is supported by the shape of their\nvelocity distribution. The projected distribution and kinematics of the\ngalaxies of other types are used to search for equilibrium solutions in the\ngravitational potential derived from the early-type galaxies, using the method\ndescribed by Binney and Mamon as implemented by Solanes and Salvador-Sole'. For\nthe brightest ellipticals we are not able to construct equilibrium solutions.\nThis is most likely the result of the formation history and the special\nlocation of these galaxies at the centres of their clusters. The data for the\nearly spirals allow equilibrium solutions and are consistent with isotropic\norbits, although there is an apparent radial anisotropy at about 0.45 r200. For\nthe late spirals an equilibrium solution with isotropic orbits is rejected by\nthe data. The orbits are nearly isotropic within about 0.7 r200, but then\nbecome increasingly radial outwards. Finally, the data for the galaxies in\nsubstructures indicate that isotropic solutions are not acceptable, and\ntangential orbits are indicated. We briefly discuss the possible implications\nof these velocity-anisotropy profiles for current ideas of the evolution and\ntransformation of galaxies in clusters.

The proposed approach is an extension of\nthe well-known Magic-Set technique and is well-suited for being integrated in\ncurrent bottom-up (stable) model inference engines. More specifically, it is\nbased on the exploitation of binding propagation techniques which reduce the\nsize of the data relevant to answer the query and, consequently, reduces both\nthe complexity of computing a single model and the number of models to be\nconsidered. The motivation of this work stems from the observation that\ntraditional binding propagation optimization techniques for bottom-up model\ngenerator systems, simulating the goal driven evaluation of top-down engines,\nare only suitable for positive (disjunctive) queries, while hard problems are\nexpressed using unstratified negation. The main contribution of the paper\nconsists in the extension of a previous technique, defined for positive\ndisjunctive queries, to queries containing both disjunctive heads and\nconstraints (a simple and expressive form of unstratified negation). As the\nusual way of expressing declaratively hard problems is based on the\nguess-and-check technique, where the guess part is expressed by means of\ndisjunctive rules and the check part is expressed by means of constraints, the\ntechnique proposed here is highly relevant for the optimization of queries\nexpressing hard problems. The value of the technique has been proved by several\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2004 12:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The dissipation rate of the oscillating scalar\nfield is calculated for various interactions such as Yukawa coupling,\nthree-body scalar interaction, and biquadratic interaction. When the background\ntemperature is larger than the oscillation frequency, the dissipation rate\narising from the interactions with fermions is suppressed due to the Pauli\nblocking, while it is enhanced for interactions with bosons due to the induced\neffect. In both cases, we find that the microphysical detailed balance relation\ndrives the oscillating field to a thermal equilibrium state.

In the case of $^{17}$C, comparison is also made with the\nresults of calculations using the transfer-to-the-continuum model. The\ncalculated 3-dimensional momentum distributions exhibit longitudinal and\ntransverse momentum components that are strongly coupled by the reaction for\ns-wave states, whilst no such effect is apparent for d-waves. Incomplete\ndetection of transverse momenta arising fromlimited experimental acceptances\nthus leads to a narrowing of the longitudinal distributions for nuclei with\nsignificant s-wave valence neutron configurations, as confirmed by the data.\nAsymmetries in the longitudinal momentum distributions attributed to\ndiffractive dissociation are also explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2004 13:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
