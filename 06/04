At a wavelength of lambda = 2.12 micron the\ndiffraction-limited resolution of 74 mas was attained. The reconstructed\nvisibility reveals a spherically symmetric, circumstellar dust shell (CDS)\nsurrounding the central star. The visibility function shows that the stellar\ncontribution to the total flux at lambda = 2.12 micron is less than ~50%,\nindicating a rather large optical depth of the CDS. The azimuthally averaged\n1-dimensional Gaussian visibility fit yields a diameter of 47 +/- 3mas (FHWM),\nwhich corresponds to 112 +/- 13 AU for an adopted distance of D = 2.38 +/- 0.24\nkpc. To determine the structure and the properties of the CDS of OH 104.9+2.4,\nradiative transfer calculations using the code DUSTY were performed to\nsimultaneously model its visibility and the spectral energy distribution (SED).\nWe found that both the ISO spectrum and the visibility of OH 104.9+2.4 can be\nwell reproduced by a radiative transfer model with an effective temperature\nT_eff = 2500 +/- 500 K of the central source, a dust temperature T_in = 1000\n+/- 200 K at the inner shell boundary R_in = 9.1 R_star = 25.4 AU, an optical\ndepth tau = 6.5 +/- 0.3 at 2.2 micron, and dust grain radii ranging from a_min\n= 0.005 +/- 0.003 micron to a_max = 0.2 +/- 0.02 micron with a power law with\nindex -3.5.

As found in previous studies, the [alpha/Fe]\nratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar\nmetallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected\nstars confirm that this is true for all major stellar components of the Galaxy,\nincluding the halo, thin disk, and thick disk. There is marginal overlap in the\nlow [alpha/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme\nretrograde orbits, but this is not supported by other element ratios, like\n[Ba/Y]. Thus, the full chemical signature of most of the dSph stars are\ndistinct from the main components of the Galaxy. This result rules out\ncontinuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during\nthe formation of the Galaxy, which is discuss further. The new environments\noffered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions\nrelated to nucleosynthesis. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -1.8) in the dSph\ngalaxies have [alpha/Fe] ratio that are consistent with predictions from the\nalpha-process (alpha-rich freeze out). This may also explain the very low Y\nabundances, and could suggest a separate r-process site for this light (first\npeak r-process) element. In stars with higher metallicities ([Fe/H] > -1.8),\ncontributions from the s-process are expected; [Ba/Y] is still much higher in\nthe dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars though, consistent with\ns-process contributions from only the low metallicity AGB stars in dSph\ngalaxies.

Focusing on\nthe ZZ-FZZT annulus amplitude as a target-space probe of the ZZ brane, we use\nit to confirm that the ZZ branes are localized in the strong-coupling region.\nAlong the way we learn that the ZZ-FZZT open strings are fermions, even though\nour theory is bosonic! We also provide a geometrical interpretation of the\nannulus amplitudes in terms of the Riemann surface M_{p,q} that emerges from\nthe FZZT branes. The ZZ-FZZT annulus amplitude measures the deformation of\nM_{p,q} due to the presence of background ZZ branes; each kind of ZZ-brane\ndeforms only one A-period of the surface. Finally, we use the annulus\namplitudes to argue that the ZZ branes can be regarded as \"wrong-branch\"\ntachyons which violate the bound \\alpha<Q/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2004 19:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2004 19:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

In\nparticular, hydrogenic one-loop Bethe logarithms are calculated for all\ncircular states (l = n-1) in the range 20 <= n <= 60 and successfully compared\nto an existing asymptotic expansion for large principal quantum number n. We\nprovide accurate expansions of the Bethe logarithm for large values of n, for\nS, P and circular Rydberg states. These three expansions are expected to give\nany Bethe logarithms for principal quantum number n > 20 to an accuracy of five\nto seven decimal digits, within the specified manifolds of atomic states.\nWithin the numerical accuracy, the results constitute unified, general formulas\nfor quantum electrodynamic corrections whose validity is not restricted to a\nsingle atomic state. The results are relevant for accurate predictions of\nradiative shifts of Rydberg states and for the description of the recently\ninvestigated laser-dressed Lamb shift, which is observable in a strong\ncoherent-wave light field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2004 20:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
