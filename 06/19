Our study shows that moderate Ni-56 mixing at velocities of < 2500\nkm/s can explain the observed light curve if the density of the outer layers of\nthe presupernova exceeds the value obtained in the evolutionary model of a\nsingle nonrotating star severalfold. Abandoning LTE and allowing for nonthermal\nionization when solving the equation of state and calculating the mean\nopacities and the thermal emission coefficient leads to a significant\ndifference between the gas temperature and the radiation temperature in the\noptically thin layers of the supernova envelope. We demonstrate the fundamental\nrole of the contribution of spectral lines to the opacity in an expanding\nenvelope and of the accurate description of radiative transfer in reproducing\nthe observed shape of the bolometric light curve. We have found that\ndisregarding the contribution of spectral lines to the opacity introduces an\nerror of 20% into the explosion energy, and that a similar error is possible\nwhen determining the mass of the ejected matter. The resonant scattering of\nradiation in numerous lines accelerates the outer layers to velocities of 36\n000 km/s; this additional acceleration affects the outer layers with a mass of\n10^{-6} Msun.

We start with the conjecture of\nHausel-Thaddeus which claims that certain Hodge numbers of moduli spaces of\nflat SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C)-connections on a smooth projective algebraic curve\nagree. We then change our point of view in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of the\ncurve, and concentrate on the SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C) character varieties of the\ncurve. Here we discuss a recent conjecture of Hausel-Rodriguez-Villegas which\nclaims, analogously to the above conjecture, that certain Hodge numbers of\nthese character varieties also agree. We explain that for Hodge numbers of\ncharacter varieties one can use arithmetic methods, and thus we end up\nexplicitly calculating, in terms of Verlinde-type formulas, the number of\nrepresentations of the fundamental group into the finite groups SL(n,F_q) and\nPGL(n,F_q), by using the character tables of these finite groups of Lie type.\nFinally we explain a conjecture which enhances the previous result, and gives a\nsimple formula for the mixed Hodge polynomials, and in particular for the\nPoincare polynomials of these character varieties, and detail the relationship\nto results of Hitchin, Gothen, Garsia-Haiman and Earl-Kirwan.

We demonstrate that these\nempirical findings can be interpreted as consequence of a mechanism of\nexchanges in a social network where firms improve their productivity by direct\ninnovation or/and by imitation of other firm's technological and organizational\nsolutions. The type of network-connectivity determines how fast and how\nefficiently information can diffuse and how quickly innovation will permeate or\nbehaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation flow through a complex\nnetwork we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are\nproportional to the connectivity of the network of links between firms. The\ncomparison with the empirical distributions reveals that such a network must be\nof a scale-free type with a power-law degree distribution in the large\nconnectivity range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2004 08:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

ISBL 97, p.157). The fusion is provided by\ncatalytic action of superheavy negative particles making up the Galactic Dark\nMatter. We called them DArk Electric Matter Objects, or daemons. The daemons\nare assumed to be elementary black holes (M ~ 10^-5 g) carrying a charge of up\nto Ze = 10e. Experiments have culminated in 2000 by the discovery of daemons.\nWe used the two-screen scintillation technique with a scintillator ZnS(Ag).\nMeasurements showed the daemon flux striking the Earth to be ~10^-9 cm^-2s^-1\nfor an object velocity of as low as ~<10-30 km/s. The half-year periodicity of\nthe flux was revealed, which can be assigned to daemons being captured into\nhelio- and geocentric orbits as the Solar system moves through the DM\nbackground (see astro-ph/0402367). The next step in creating a daemon-mediated\nBL to achieve controlled energy generation through catalytic fusion of carbon\nnuclei will be a search for methods of capture and stable holding of a daemon,\nwhich could involve the use of the tip of a carbon fiber, as it apparently\noccurs in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2004 12:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

(ii) The universal wave function has a tree structure, whose\nbranches are generated by the measurement processes and are spatially\ndisjoined.
