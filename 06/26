We review the role of those terms in gauge theories\nwith massless fermions and Chern-Simons theories. The explicit form of\nnon-analytic terms turns out to be dependent on the regularization scheme and\nin consequence the very existence of phenomena like parity and framing\nanomalies becomes regularization dependent. In particular we find\nregularization regimes where both anomalies are absent. Due to the presence of\nnon-analytic terms the effective action becomes not only discontinuous but also\nsingular for some background gauge fields which include sphalerons. The\nappearence of this type of singularities is linked to the existence of nodal\nconfigurations in physical states and tunneling suppression at some classical\nfield configurations. In the topological field theory the number of physical\nstates may also become regularization dependent. Another consequence of the\npeculiar behaviour of three-dimensional theories under parity odd\nregularizations is the existence of a simple mechanism of generation of a mass\ngap in pure Yang-Mills theory by a suitable choice of regularization scheme.\nThe generic value of this mass does agree with the values obtained in\nHamiltonian and numerical analysis. Finally, the existence of different\nregularization regimes unveils the difficulties of establishing a Zamolodchikov\nc-theorem for three-dimensional field theories in terms of the induced\ngravitational Chern-Simons couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2004 17:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

This paper improves that theorem\nin several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we\nmake the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in\nthe number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the\nimproved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP\n(CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we\nshow that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the\nclassical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are\nprobably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient\nalgorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states,\nputting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a \"canonical form\" that requires at\nmost O(n^2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our\nsimulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a\nlimited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general\ntensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2004 17:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 2004 20:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2004 00:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2004 02:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2008 19:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
