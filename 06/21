Under the circumstance that this modification\ncannot be limited to the addition of a mere cosmological constant, a serious\nsituation has emerged in cosmology, in which the energy densities in the\nuniverse have become largely speculative. In this situation, an equation of\nstate of the form p=w \\rho itself is not well-motivated. In this paper, we\nargue that the reasonable option left is to make a model-independent analysis\nof SNe data, without reference to the energy densities. In this basically\nkinematic approach, we limit ourselves to the observationally justifiable\nassumptions of homogeneity and isotropy; i.e., to the assumption that the\nuniverse has a RW metric. This cosmographic approach is historically the\noriginal one to cosmology. We perform the analysis by expanding the scale\nfactor into a polynomial of order 5, which assumption can be further\ngeneralised to any order. The present expansion rates h, q_0, r_0 etc. are\nevaluated by computing the marginal likelihoods for these parameters. These\nvalues are relevant, since any cosmological solution would ultimately need to\nexplain them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2004 18:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

Assuming that the\nplanet opened a gap in the viscous disk, we estimate that the planet mass is\ngreater than 0.1 Jupiter masses. This estimate depends on a lower limit to the\ndisk viscosity derived from the time scale needed to accrete the inner disk,\ncreating the now detectable hole. The planet migration time scale must at least\nmodestly exceed the time for the spectrally inferred hole to clear. The\nproximity of the planet to the disk edge implied by our limits suggests that\nthe latter is perturbed by the nearby planet and may exhibit a spiral pattern\nrotating with the planet. This pattern might be resolved with current ground\nbased mid-infrared cameras and optical cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe required sub-Myr planet formation may challenge core accretion formation\nmodels.

Although this value is ~\n15% larger than the galaxy's Cepheid distance, the discrepancy likely arises\nfrom differing assumptions about the system's internal extinction. Our\nphotometry (which extends >3 mag down the PNLF), also reveals that the\nfaint-end of M33's PN luminosity function is non-monotonic, with an inflection\npoint ~2 mag below the PNLF cutoff. We argue that this feature is due to the\ngalaxy's large population of high core-mass planetaries, and that its amplitude\nmay eventually be useful as a diagnostic for studies of stellar populations.\n  Fiber-coupled spectroscopy of 140 of the PN candidates confirms that M33's PN\npopulation rotates along with the old disk, with a small asymmetric drift of \\~\n10km/s. Remarkably, the population's line-of-sight velocity dispersion varies\nlittle over ~4 optical disk scale lengths, with sigma_{rad}~20km/s.
