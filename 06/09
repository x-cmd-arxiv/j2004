A comparison of this burst\nto true photospheric radius expansion bursts in 4U 1636-53 leads us to conclude\nthat these bursts-with-precursor do not reach the Eddington limit. We further\nreport on the analysis of a 22.4 ksec observation of XTE J1709-267 obtained\nwith the Chandra satellite when the source was in quiescence. We found that the\nsource has a soft quiescent spectrum which can be fit well by an absorbed black\nbody or neutron star atmosphere model. A power law contributes less than 10 per\ncent to the 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux of (1.0+-0.3)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1.\nThis flux is the same within the errors as the flux measured right after the\noutburst in 2002, indicating that the quiescent flux was reached within a few\nweeks after the outburst. Finally, we compared the power-law fractional\ncontribution to the unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity for neutron star SXTs in\nquiescence for which the distance is well-known.

The simulations are used to obtain the\ncloud and shadow curve properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid having diameters\ndistributed according to a Schulz form with a large (40%) degree of\npolydispersity. Good qualitative accord is found with the results from a MFE\nmethod study of a corresponding van der Waals model that incorporates\nsize-dispersity both in the hard core reference and the attractive parts of the\nfree energy. The results show that polydispersity engenders considerable\nbroadening of the coexistence region between the cloud curves. The principal\neffect of fractionation in this region is a common overall scaling of the\nparticle sizes and typical inter-particle distances, and we discuss why this\neffect is rather specific to systems with Schulz diameter distributions. Next,\nby studying a family of such systems with distributions of various widths, we\nestimate the dependence of the critical point parameters on $\\delta$.

One aspect of\nthese interactions is the existence of many binary bound states of\nquasiparticles. Only $\\bar q q$ ones have been so far directly seen on the\nlattice, for charmed and light quarks, but other attractive channels in $ qg,\ngg$ are likely to have them as well. It was argued in our previous paper that\nsuch bound states account for a significant part of the bulk properties such as\ndensity and pressure. Using the same model, we evaluate the energy loss $dE/dx$\ndue to the ionization of these states. We found that it is substantial, but\nonly in the narrow interval of temperatures $T=(1.4-1.7)T_c$. In contrast to\nthat, we show that radiative and elastic losses are not likely to be modified\nmuch by binding, as the total density of color charges is close to what it is\nfor weakly coupled quasiparticles.

The further requirement that this value of the Yukawa\ncoupling, at the weak scale, be compatible with the existence of a third\nvacuum, with a Higgs field expectation value of the order of the fundamental\nscale, enforces a hierarchical scale ratio between the fundamental and weak\nscales of order $10^{16}$ -- $10^{20}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2004 14:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
