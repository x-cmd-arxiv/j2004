The primordial abundance of any one nuclide can, therefore, be used to\nmeasure the baryon abundance and the value derived from the observationally\ninferred primordial abundance of deuterium closely matches that from current,\nnon-BBN data, primarily from the WMAP survey. However, using this same estimate\nthere is a tension between the SBBN-predicted 4He and 7Li abundances and their\ncurrent, observationally inferred primordial abundances, suggesting that N_nu\nmay differ from the standard model value of three and/or that there may be a\nnon-zero neutral lepton asymmetry (or, that systematic errors in the abundance\ndeterminations have been underestimated or overlooked). The differences are not\nlarge and the allowed ranges of the BBN parameters permitted by the data are\nquite small.

A strong new dust emission feature,\npresumed due to PAHs, was discovered at 17.1um. The feature's intensity is\nnearly half that of the ubiquitous 11.3um band. The 7-14um spectral maps\nrevealed significant variation in the 7.7 and 11.3um PAH features between the\nstellar ring and nucleus. Weak [OIV] 25.9um line emission was found to be\ncentrally concentrated in the nucleus, with an observed strength over 10% of\nthe combined neon line flux, indicating an AGN or unusually active massive star\nphoto-ionization. Two [SIII] lines fix the characteristic electron density in\nthe HII regions at n_e < ~200 cm^-3. Three detected H_2 rotational lines,\ntracing warm molecular gas, together with the observed IR continuum, are\ndifficult to match with standard PDR models.

In this paper we propose a scenario where the\ninflaton energy density is dumped into the bulk in a brane world setup, and all\nthe required physical conditions are created by the right handed neutrino\nsector within supersymmetry. The scalar component of the right handed Majorana\nneutrino is responsible for generating the scale invariant fluctuations in the\ncosmic microwave background radiation, reheating the Universe at a\ntemperature~$T_{rh}\\leq 10^{9}$ GeV, and finally generating the lepton/baryon\nasymmetry, $n_{B}/s\\sim 10^{-10}$, with no lepton/baryon isocurvature\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2004 01:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2004 19:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The result is that two of the Einstein equations arise as exact\nequations of motion and one of the usual Einstein equations (suitably\nquantized) survives as a constraint equation to be imposed on the space of\nphysical states. However, the Friedmann equation, which is also a constraint\nequation and which is the basis of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, acquires a\nwelcome quantum correction that becomes significant for small scale factors. To\nclarify the general formalism and explicitly show why we choose to weaken the\nstatement of the Wheeler-deWitt equation, we apply the general formalism to de\nSitter space. After exactly solving the relevant Heisenberg equations of motion\nwe give a detailed discussion of the subtleties associated with defining\nphysical states and the emergence of the classical theory.

The nature of fission\ntransients is dependent on the assumed initial distribution of the compound\nnuclei along the fission coordinate. Although the standard initial assumption\nof a near-spherical object leads to a transient suppression of the fission rate\n(fission delay), a moderate initial fissionlike deformation can reduce the\nmagnitude of this suppression. For still larger initial deformations, transient\nfission enhancements are possible. Examples of this behavior are illustrated\nvia a one-dimensional Langevin simulation. It is argued that the initial\nconditions are determined by the fusion dynamics and thus are entrance-channel\ndependent. Transient fission may be considered intermediate between statistical\nfission and quasifission as the rapid time scale of transient fission may not\nlead to an equilibrium of the angular and mass-asymmetry coordinates. The\nrelationship between the mean first passage time and the transients are\ndiscussed. For temperatures much smaller than the fission barrier, the mean\nfirst passage time is independent of the nature of the fission transients if\nthere is no strong competition from evaporation.
