The goal of this article is to determine the boundary maps of\nthis CW-complex, in the case where M is compact and orientable.\n  First, the boundary maps are defined in terms of the modified gradient flow.\nThen a transversality condition is imposed which insures that the attaching map\nis non-degenerate in a neighborhood of each critical point. The degree of this\nmap is then interpreted as a sum of trajectories connecting two critical points\neach counted with a multiplicity determined by a choice of orientations on the\ntangent spaces of the unstable manifold at each critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2004 19:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2004 19:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
