With their large field of view\nand high spatial resolution, the Fabry-Perot data allow to probe\nsimultaneously, in 2-D, two kinematical features of the tidal ionized gas:\nlarge-scale velocity gradients due to streaming motions along the tails, and\nsmall-scale motions related to the internal dynamics of giant HII regions\nwithin the tails. In several interacting systems, massive (10^9 Msun)\ncondensations of HI, CO and stars are observed in the outer regions of tails.\nWhether they are genuine accumulations of matter or not is still debated.\nIndeed a part of the tidal tail may be aligned with the line-of-sight, and the\nassociated projection effect may result in apparent accumulations of matter\nthat does not exist in the 3-D space. Using numerical simulations, we show that\nstudying the large-scale kinematics of tails, it is possible to know whether\nthese accumulations of matter are the result of projection effects or not. We\nconclude that several ones are genuine accumulations of matter. We also study\nthe small-scale motions inside these regions: several small-scale velocity\ngradients are identified with projected values as large as 50-100 km/s accross\nthe observed HII regions. In one system, the spatial resolution of our\nobservations is sufficient to detail the velocity field; we show that it is\nrotating and self-gravitating, and discuss its dark matter content.

This diagnostic is based on the FIR normalized\n6.2 um PAH flux and the FIR normalized 6.2 um continuum flux. The Galactic\nsources form a sequence spanning a range of 3 orders of magnitude, from\nembedded compact HII regions to exposed PDRs and the (D)ISM. The variation in\nthe 6.2 um PAH/continuum ratio is relative small. Normal and starburst galaxies\nressemble exposed PDRs. While Seyfert-2's coincide with the starburst trend,\nSeyfert-1's are displaced by at least a factor 10 in 6.2 um continuum flux.\nULIRGs show a diverse spectral appearance (AGN hot dust continuum,\nstarburst-like or strong dust obscuration in the nucleus). ULIRGs also seems to\nhave more prominent FIR emission than either starburst galaxies or AGNs. We\ndiscuss the observed variation in the Galactic sample in view of the\nevolutionary state and the PAH/dust abundance and the use of PAHs as\nquantitative tracers of star formation activity. We find that PAHs may be\nbetter suited as a tracer of B stars, which dominate the Galactic stellar\nenergy budget, than as a tracer of massive star formation (O stars).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2004 18:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The correct theory of\nrelativity is the one with a preferred cosmic rest frame. Yet, the theory\npreserves Lorentz invariance.

We find quite distinct practical\nconsequences of nonlinear nuclear k_t-factorization for interactions of\npointlike photons and non-pointlike pions. In the former case the large\ntransverse momentum p_t of jets comes from the intrinsic momentum of quarks and\nantiquarks in the photon and nuclear effects manifest themselves as an\nazimuthal decorrelation with an acoplanarity momentum of the order of the\nnuclear saturation momentum Q_A. In the breakup of pions off free nucleons to\nthe leading order in pQCD the spectator parton has a small transverse momentum\nand the hard dijet cross section is suppressed. In the breakup of pions off\nheavy nuclei the forward hard jets are predicted to be entirely decorrelated.\nWe comment on the sensitivity of the pionic dijet cross section to the pion\ndistribution amplitude. The predicted distinction between the breakup of\nphotons and pions can be tested by the sphericity and thrust analysis of the\nforward hadronic system in the COMPASS experiment at CERN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2004 16:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The first is the phenomenon of intermittency in the\ndissipation field. Dissipation-range intermittency was first discovered\nexperimentally by Batchelor and Townsend over fifty years ago. It is\ncharacterized by spatio-temporal binary behaviour in which long, quiescent\nperiods in the velocity signal are interrupted by short, active `events' during\nwhich there are violent fluctuations away from the average. The second and\nrelated problem is whether solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations develop\nfinite time singularities during these events. This paper shows that Leray's\nweak solutions of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\ncan have a binary character in time. The time-axis is split into `good' and\n`bad' intervals: on the `good' intervals solutions are bounded and regular,\nwhereas singularities are still possible within the `bad' intervals. An\nestimate for the width of the latter is very small and decreases with\nincreasing Reynolds number. It also decreases relative to the lengths of the\ngood intervals as the Reynolds number increases. Within these `bad' intervals,\nlower bounds on the local energy dissipation rate and other quantities, such as\n$\\|\\bu(\\cdot, t)\\|_{\\infty}$ and $\\|\\nabla\\bu(\\cdot, t)\\|_{\\infty}$, are very\nlarge, resulting in strong dynamics at sub-Kolmogorov scales. Intersections of\nbad intervals for $n\\geq 1$ are related to Scheffer's potentially singular set\nin time. It is also proved that the Navier-Stokes equations are conditionally\nregular provided, in a given `bad' interval, the energy has a lower bound that\nis decaying exponentially in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2004 11:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The computation of associated probabilities and distributions\nhowever needs the explicit knowledge of a relevant sample of trajectories and\ntherefore implies formidable numerical effort. Here a trajectory free\nformulation for the average transmission and reflection dwell times within\nstatic spatial intervals [a,b] is given for one-dimensional scattering\nproblems. This formulation reduces the computation time to less than 5% of the\ncomputation time by means of trajectory sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2004 12:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2005 13:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
