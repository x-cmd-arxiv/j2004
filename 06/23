Updated\ncosmological constraints are obtained, free of systematics caused by PSF\nanisotropy. To facilitate general use of our results, we provide the two-points\nstatistics data points with their covariance matrices up to a scale of one\ndegree. For the normalisation of the mass power spectrum we obtain\nsigma_8=(0.83\\pm 0.07)(Omega_M/0.3)^(-0.49). The shape parameter Gamma was\nmarginalised over Gamma=[0.1,0.3] and the mean source redshift z_s over\n[0.8,1.0]. The latter is consistent with recent photometric redshifts obtained\nfor the VIRMOS data and the preliminary spectroscopic redshifts from the\nVIRMOS-VVDS survey.

The\nsurfactants are modeled as coarse-grained lattice polymers, while the Monte\nCarlo shear flow is implemented with an externally imposed potential energy\nfield which induces a linear drag velocity on the surfactants. It is shown that\nin the absence of shear, cylindrical micelles confined within a monolayer\ncoarsen gradually with Monte Carlo \"time\" t, the persistence length of the\nmicelles scaling as t^{0.24}, in agreement with the scaling obtained\nexperimentally. Under the imposition of shear, the micelles within a monolayer\nalign parallel to the direction of shear, as observed experimentally. Micelles\nconfined within thicker films also align parallel to each other with a\nhexagonal packing under shear, but assume a finite tilt with respect to the\nvelocity vector within the velocity-velocity gradient plane.

A Bose condensate of rubidium atoms tightly\nconfined in a static harmonic magnetic trap is exposed to a one-dimensional\noptical standing-wave potential that is pulsed on periodically. We focus on the\nquantum anti-resonance case for which the classical periodic behavior is simple\nand well understood. We show that after a small number of kicks the dynamics is\ndominated by dephasing of matter wave interference due to the finite width of\nthe condensate's initial momentum distribution. In addition, we demonstrate\nthat the nonlinear mean-field interaction in a typical harmonically confined\nBose condensate is not sufficient to give rise to chaotic behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2004 06:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Among the effects that Lorentz violation\ncan introduce are a dependence on energy differing from that of the usual\nmassive-neutrino solution and a dependence on the direction of neutrino\npropagation. Using the results of the LSND experiment, explicit analysis of the\neffects of broken Lorentz symmetry yields a nonzero value (3+/-1) x 10^{-19}\nGeV for a combination of coefficients for Lorentz violation.

As an regularization procedure the generalized zeta function\ntechnique is used, in combination with contour integral representations. The\nsurface energies on the branes are presented in the form of the sums of single\nbrane and second brane-induced parts. For the geometry of a single brane both\nregions, on the left (L-region) and on the right (R-region), of the brane are\nconsidered. The surface densities for separate L- and R-regions contain pole\nand finite contributions.

The parts in the surface densities generated by the presence\nof the second brane are finite for all nonzero values of the interbrane\nseparation. It is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced\nsurface densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological\nconstant on the brane.

They demonstrated that this class of\nprocedures has an oracle property when the number of parameters is finite.\nHowever, in most model selection problems the number of parameters should be\nlarge and grow with the sample size. In this paper some asymptotic properties\nof the nonconcave penalized likelihood are established for situations in which\nthe number of parameters tends to \\infty as the sample size increases.\n  Under regularity conditions we have established an oracle property and the\nasymptotic normality of the penalized likelihood estimators. Furthermore, the\nconsistency of the sandwich formula of the covariance matrix is demonstrated.\n  Nonconcave penalized likelihood ratio statistics are discussed, and their\nasymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis are obtained by imposing\nsome mild conditions on the penalty functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2004 12:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
