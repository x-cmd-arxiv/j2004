The clusters\nhave similar temperatures (kT=2.65, 2.53 and 2.58 keV), and similar redshifts\n(0.04 < z < 0.06). We trace the surface brightness, temperature, entropy and\nintegrated mass profiles up to 0.5 (0.35 for MKW9) of the virial radius\n(r_200). The integrated mass profiles are very similar in physical units and\nare reasonably well fitted with the NFW mass model with concentration\nparameters of c_200=4-6 and M_200=1.2-1.6 X 10^14 h_70^-1 \\msun. The entropy\nprofiles are similar at large scale, but there is some scatter in the central\nregion (r<50 kpc). None of the clusters has an isentropic core. Including XMM\ndata on A1983 (kT=2.2 keV), and A1413 (kT = 6.5 keV), we discuss the structural\nand scaling properties of cluster mass and entropy profiles. The scaled mass\nprofiles display <20% dispersion in the 0.05 - 0.5 r_200 radial range. The\nc_200 parameters of these clusters, and other values from the literature, are\nfully consistent with the c_200 - M_200 relation derived from simulations. The\ndispersion in scaled entropy profiles is small, implying self-similarity down\nto low mass (kT ~2 keV), and is reduced by 30-40% (to ~20%) if we use the\nempirical relation S \\propto T^0.65 instead of the standard self-similar\nrelation, S \\propto T. The mean scaled profile is well fitted by a power law\nfor 0.05 < r_200 < 0.5, with a slope slightly lower than expected from pure\nshock heating (\\alpha = 0.94+/-0.14), and a normalisation at 0.1 r_200\nconsistent with previous studies.

Thus, for each type of variable there exists a different\nunderlying social network, which we refer to as a ``layer''. Each layer\nconnects the same set of agents by a different set of links defining a\ndifferent topology. In different layers, the nature of the variables and their\ndynamics may be different (Ising, Heisenberg, matrix models, etc). The\ndifferent variables belonging to the same agent interact (the level of optimism\nof an agent may influence its saving level), thus coupling the various layers.\nWe present a simple instance of such a network, where a one-dimensional Ising\nchain (representing the interaction between the optimist-pessimist\nexpectations) is coupled through a random site-to-site mapping to a\none-dimensional generalized Blume-Capel chain (representing the dynamics of the\nagents' saving ratios). In the absence of coupling between the layers, the\none-dimensional systems describing respectively the expectations and the saving\nratios do not feature any ordered phase (herding).

In fact, within the framework of Lorentzian\nRelativity, they might indicate the existence of a preferred frame relatively\nto which the Earth is moving with a velocity v_earth\\sim 200$ km/s (value\nprojected in the plane of the interferometer). We have checked this idea by\ncomparing with the modern ether-drift experiments, those where the observation\nof the fringe shifts is replaced by the difference \\Delta \\nu in the relative\nfrequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers, upon local rotations of the\napparatus or under the Earth's rotation. It turns out that, even in this case,\nthe most recent data are consistent with the same value of the Earth's\nvelocity, once the vacuum within the cavities is considered a physical medium\nwhose refractive index is fixed by General Relativity. We thus propose a sharp\nexperimental test that can definitely resolve the issue. If the small\ndeviations observed in the classical ether-drift experiments were not mere\ninstrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum in the resonating cavities\nwith a dielectric gaseous medium (e.g. air), the typical measured \\Delta\\nu\\sim\n1 Hz should increase by orders of magnitude. This expectation is consistent\nwith the characteristic modulation of a few kHz observed in the original\nexperiment with He-Ne masers.

For\nactive optics corrections, all three errors, which can partially compensate\neach other, are measured simultaneously. It is therefore of interest to\nunderstand the similarities and differences between the three corresponding\ntypes of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best\nrepresented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them\nbeing continuous and smooth functions. The segment misaligment modes, which are\nderived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in\ngeneral discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments,\nthe lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper\nderives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators\nand their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For\nsegmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these\nmodes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition\nmodes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment\nmisalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes\nof monolithic mirrors. Some mathematical features emerge as identical in the\ntwo cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 08:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the simplest\ncase of only one molecular state, corresponding to either a Feshbach resonance\nor one-color photoassociation, the system displays Rabi oscillations and rapid\nadiabatic passage between a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic\nmolecules. For two-color photoassociation, the system admits stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms to stable Fermi\nmolecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring\nthe STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of\nthe initial atoms, leaving a finite fraction of bosons behind to induce\natom-molecule Cooper pairing via density fluctuations; unfortunately, this\nenhancement is insufficient to achieve a superfluid transition with present\nultracold technology. We therefore propose the use of an association resonance\nthat converts atoms and diatomic molecules (dimers) into triatomic molecules\n(trimers), which leads to a crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate of\ntrimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs. Because heteronuclear dimers may possess a\npermanent electric dipole moment, this overall system presents an opportunity\nto investigate novel microscopic physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 13:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
