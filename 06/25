We review the calculations required to include SMBHs in\ntwo standard galactic lens models, a cored isothermal sphere and a broken power\nlaw. The presence of the SMBH produces two primary effects depending on the\nlens configuration, either blocking the ``core'' image that is usually\npredicted to form from a softened lens model, or adding an extra, highly\ndemagnified, image to the predictions of the unaltered lens model. The\nmagnitudes of these effects are very sensitive to galaxy core sizes and SMBH\nmasses.

The theory describes the time evolution\nof a condensed atomic ensemble under the influence of an arbitrarily varying\nnear resonant laser pulse, which strongly modifies the binary scattering\nproperties. In particular, when considering situations with rapid variations\nand high light intensities the approach described in this article leads, in a\nconsistent way, beyond standard mean field techniques. This allows to address\nthe question of limits to the photoassociation rate due to many body effects\nwhich has caused extensive discussions in the recent past. Both, the possible\nloss rate of condensate atoms and the amount of stable ground state molecules\nachievable within a certain time are found to be stronger limited than\naccording to mean field theory. By systematically treating the dynamics of the\nconnected Green's function for pair correlations the resonantly driven\npopulation of the excited molecular state as well as scattering into the\ncontinuum of non-condensed atomic states are taken into account. A detailed\nanalysis of the low energy stationary scattering properties of two atoms\nmodified by the near resonant photoassociation laser, in particular of the\ndressed state spectrum of the relative motion prepares for the analysis of the\nmany body dynamics. The consequences of the finite lifetime of the resonantly\ncoupled bound state are discussed in the two body as well as in the many body\ncontext.

To this data one can attach a family of algebras\n$H_{t,c}(V,G)$, parametrized by complex numbers $t$ and conjugation invariant\nfunctions $c$ on the set of complex reflections in $G$, which are called\nrational Cherednik algebras. These algebras have been studied for over 15 years\nand revealed a rich structure and deep connections with algebraic geometry,\nrepresentation theory, and combinatorics. In this paper, we define global\nanalogs of Cherednik algebras, attached to any smooth algebraic or analytic\nvariety $X$ with a finite group $G$ of automorphisms. We show that many\ninteresting properties of Cherednik algebras (such as the PBW theorem,\nuniversal deformation property, relation to Calogero-Moser spaces, action on\nquasiinvariants) still hold in the global case, and give several interesting\nexamples.
