Such a perfect blackbody spectrum is puzzling since\nradiative transport through typical neutron star atmospheres causes noticeable\ndeviation from blackbody. Previous studies have shown that in a strong magnetic\nfield, the outermost layer of the neutron star may be in a condensed solid or\nliquid form because of the greatly enhanced cohesive energy of the condensed\nmatter. The critical temperature of condensation increases with the magnetic\nfield strength, and can be as high as 10^6 K (for Fe surface at B \\sim 10^{13}\nG or H surface at B \\sim a few times 10^{14} G). Thus the thermal radiation can\ndirectly emerge from the degenerate metallic condensed surface, without going\nthrough a gaseous atmosphere. Here we calculate the emission properties\n(spectrum and polarization) of the condensed Fe and H surfaces of magnetic\nneutron stars in the regimes where such condensation may be possible. For a\nsmooth condensed surface, the overall emission is reduced from the blackbody by\nless than a factor of 2. The spectrum exhibits modest deviation from blackbody\nacross a wide energy range, and shows mild absorption features associated with\nthe ion cyclotron frequency and the electron plasma frequency in the condensed\nmatter. The roughness of the solid condensate (in the Fe case) tends to\ndecrease the reflectivity of the surface, and make the emission spectrum even\ncloser to blackbody.

This paper explores expectations for burst emission spectra arising\nfrom shock acceleration theory in the limit of particles cooling much slower\nthan their acceleration. Parametric fits to burst spectra obtained by the\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) are explored for the cases of the\nsynchrotron, inverse Compton and synchrotron self-Compton radiation mechanisms,\nusing a linear combination of thermal and non-thermal electron populations.\nThese fits demand that the preponderance of electrons that are responsible for\nthe prompt emission reside in an intrinsically non-thermal population, strongly\ncontrasting particle distributions obtained from acceleration simulations. This\nimplies a potential conflict for acceleration scenarios where the non-thermal\nelectrons are drawn directly from a thermal gas. It is also found that the CGRO\ndata preclude effective spectroscopic discrimination between the synchrotron\nand inverse Compton mechanisms. This situation may be resolved with future\nmissions probing gamma-ray bursts, namely Swift and GLAST.

In this paper, we calculate the angular distribution of\ngeoneutrinos, which opens a window on the differential radionuclide\ndistribution. We develop the general formalism for the neutrino angular\ndistribution, and we present the inverse transformation which recovers the\nterrestrial radioisotope distribution given a measurement of the neutrino\nangular distribution. Thus, geoneutrinos not only allow a means to image the\nEarth's interior, but offering a direct measure of the radioactive Earth, both\n(1) revealing the Earth's inner structure as probed by radionuclides, and (2)\nallowing for a complete determination of the radioactive heat generation as a\nfunction of radius.

In this\nmodel the neutrino generation is dominated by decays in the Earth's mantle and\ncrust; this leads to a very ``peripheral'' angular distribution, in which 2/3\nof the neutrinos come from angles > 60 degrees away from the downward vertical.\nWe note the possibility of that the Earth's core contains potassium; different\ngeophysical predictions lead to strongly varying, and hence distinguishable,\ncentral intensities (< 30 degrees from the downward vertical).

We present a simple set of\nnormalized Yukawa matrices, with only two real parameters and one complex\nphase, which accounts with precision for these mass relations and for the CKM\nmatrix elements and also suggests a simpler parametrization of the CKM matrix.\nThe proposed Yukawa matrices accommodate the measured CP-violation, giving a\nparticular relation between standard model CP-violating phases, beta=Arg(2 -\nexp^{-i*gamma}). According to this relation, the measured value of beta is\nclose to the maximum value that can be reached. Finally, the particular mass\nrelations with the charged lepton sector find their simplest explanation in the\ncontext of grand unified models through the use of the Georgi-Jarlskog factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 2004 22:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2004 20:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2004 06:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The structural representation is based on the Principal Eigenvector\nof the fold's contact matrix (PE). As recently shown, the latter encodes\nsufficient information for reconstructing the whole contact matrix. The\nsequence is represented through a Hydrophobicity Profile (HP), using a\ngeneralized hydrophobicity scale that we obtain from the principal eigenvector\nof a residue-residue interaction matrix and denote it as interactivity scale.\nUsing this novel scale, we define the optimal HP of a protein fold, and\npredict, by means of stability arguments, that it is strongly correlated with\nthe PE of the fold's contact matrix. This prediction is confirmed through an\nevolutionary analysis, which shows that the PE correlates with the HP of each\nindividual sequence adopting the same fold and, even more strongly, with the\naverage HP of this set of sequences. Thus, protein sequences evolve in such a\nway that their average HP is close to the optimal one, implying that neutral\nevolution can be viewed as a kind of motion in sequence space around the\noptimal HP. Our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between\nN-dimensional vectors constitutes a natural metric in the vectorial space in\nwhich we represent both protein sequences and protein structures, which we call\nVectorial Protein Space. In this way, we define a unified framework for\nsequence to sequence, sequence to structure, and structure to structure\nalignments.

This is\nrelated to the unobservability of the global phase in interference. We also\nshow how local energy decoherence, which acts separately on system and phase\nreference, could be detected with remarkable sensitivity and over a wide range\nof length scales by long-distance Ramsey interferometry with metastable atomic\nstates.
