The TW Hya association with an age of 8 Myr, the\nBeta Pictoris moving group with 12 Myr and a combination of Tucana and\nHorologium associations (30 Myr). Two low and high rotation modes are\nconsidered for each association with stellar masses less than 1.5M and greater\nthan 1.5M respectively. We infer representative equatorial rotation velocities\nVo from the observed distribution of projected rotational velocities vsini. A\nspin up is found for the high rotation mode, whereas in the low rotation mode\nthe Vo do not increase significantly. This insufficient increase of Vo is\nprobably the cause of a decrease of the total mean specific angular momentum\nfor the low mass stars between 8 and 30 Myr. However, for the high mass stars,\nwhere a sufficient spin up is present, the specific angular momentum is\npractically conserved in this same time interval.

The analysis of rotation and stellar masses using luminosity\nX-rays indicators present similar properties, as the dependence on stellar mass\nand rotation, at least for the younger associations, to those obtained for T\nTauri stars in the ONC.

The turbulence is assumed to be\nanisotropic, due to the stratification, with stronger transport in the\nhorizontal directions than in the vertical. The main difference with the former\ntreatments by Zahn (1992) and Maeder & Zahn (1998) is that we expand here the\ndepartures from spherical symmetry to higher order, and include explicitly the\ndifferential rotation in latitude, to first order. This allows us to treat\nsimultaneously the bulk of a radiation zone and its tachocline(s). Moreover, we\ntake fully into account the non-stationarity of the problem, which will enable\nus to tackle the rapid phases of evolution. The system of partial differential\nequations, which govern the transport of angular momentum, heat and chemical\nelements, is written in a form which makes it ready to implement in a stellar\nevolution code. Here the effect of a magnetic field is deliberately ignored; it\nwill be included in forthcoming papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2004 13:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

It is shown that the joint measurability of noncommuting\nobservables is a consequence of the quantum formalism if unsharp observables\nare taken into account; a fact not in conflict with the idea of\ncomplementarity, which, in its strongest version, was originally formulated\nonly for sharp observables. As an illustration of the general theory, the\nwave-particle duality of photons is analysed in terms of complementary path and\ninterference observables and their unsharp joint measurability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2004 15:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}
