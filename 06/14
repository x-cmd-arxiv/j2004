This is the predicted `textbook case' of an intervening DLA\ngalaxy if DLA galaxies are small, but would not be expected if intervening high\nredshift DLA galaxies have large gaseous disks. The Ly-alpha flux is\n5.4{+2}{-0.8} * 1e-17 ergs/s/cm2 similar to what has been found in previously\nknown high z DLA galaxies. The impact parameter is found to be 0.3+-0.3 arcsec.\nThis is smaller than what was found in previous cases but still consistent with\nrandom sight-lines through absorbers with mean impact parameter ~1 arcsec. Of\nthe 24 DLAs targeted in the NICMOS imaging survey five have now been identified\nas Ly-alpha emitters. The DLA galaxies with detected Ly-alpha emission tend to\nhave higher interstellar metallicities than those with undetected Ly-alpha\nemission. This is plausibly explained as a consequence of a positive\ncorrelation between the Ly-alpha line luminosities of the galaxies and their\nmetallicities, although the present sample is too small for a definitive\nconclusion. The available observations of high-redshift DLA galaxies are also\nconsistent with a negative correlation between Ly-alpha equivalent widths and\nmetallicities, as seen in nearby star-forming galaxies and usually attributed\nto the preferential absorption of Ly-alpha photons by dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2004 16:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For instance, any number of\nextreme Reissner-Nordstrom solutions (which in vacuum reduce to extreme\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes) located at will is a solution. In matter one\ncan also find solutions with some ease. Here we find an exact solution of the\nMajumdar-Papapetrou system, a spherically symmetric charged thick shell, with\nmass m, outer radius r_o, and inner radius r_i.

The channel is designed so that\nthe data's evolution can be exactly inferred by a classically coordinated\nprocessing of 1) the control output, and 2) a reference system entangled with\nthe control input, but not from either of these resources alone. Thus a two-way\nclassical side channel allows the otherwise noisy evolution of the data to be\ncorrected, greatly increasing the capacity. The same family of channels\nprovides examples where the classical capacity assisted by classical feedback,\n$C_B$, and the quantum capacity assisted by classical feedback $Q_B$, both\nexceed $C_H$. A related channel, whose data input undergoes dephasing before\ninteracting with the control input, has a classical capacity $C=C_H$ strictly\nless than its $C_2$, the classical capacity assisted by independent classical\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2004 08:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In a\nparticular case of a qubit channel a complete reconstruction of the map E can\nbe performed via complete tomography of four output states E[rho_j ] that\noriginate from a set of four linearly independent test states j (j = 1, 2, 3,\n4) at the input of the channel. We study the situation when less than four\nlinearly independent states are transmitted via the channel and measured at the\noutput. We present strategies how to reconstruct the channel when just one, two\nor three states are transmitted via the channel. In particular, we show that if\njust one state is transmitted via the channel then the best reconstruction can\nbe achieved when this state is a total mixture described by the density\noperator rho = I/2. To improve the reconstruction procedure one has to send via\nthe channel more states. The best strategy is to complement the total mixture\nwith pure states that are mutually orthogonal in the sense of the Bloch-sphere\nrepresentation. We show that unitary transformations (channels) can be uniquely\nreconstructed (determined) based on the information of how three properly\nchosen input states are transformed under the action of the channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2004 09:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}
