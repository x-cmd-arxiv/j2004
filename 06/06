The quantum approach predicts the existence of\ncertain macroscopic quantum structures that are WIMP-like even when occupied by\ntraditional baryonic particles. These structures function as dark matter\ncandidates for CDM theory on large scales where it has been most successful,\nand retain the potential to yield observationally compliant predictions on\ngalactic cluster and sub-cluster scales. Relatively pure, high angular\nmomentum, eigenstate solutions obtained from Schrodinger's equation in weak\ngravity form the structural basis. They have no classical analogue, and\nproperties radically different from those of traditional localised matter\n(whose eigenstate spectra contain negligible quantities of such states).\nSalient features include radiative lifetimes that can exceed the age of the\nuniverse, energies and 'sizes' consistent with galactic halos, and negligible\ninteraction rates with radiation and macroscopic galactic objects. This\nfacilitates the formation of sparsely populated macroscopic quantum structures\nthat are invisible and stable. Viable structure formation scenarios are based\non the seed potential wells of primordial black holes formed at the e+/e- phase\ntransition. The structures can potentially produce suitable internal density\ndistributions and have capacity to accommodate the required amount of halo dark\nmatter. The formation scenarios show that it is possible to incorporate\nstructures into universal evolutionary scenarios without significantly\ncompromising the results of WMAP or the measurements of elemental BBN ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2004 09:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-02"}

The curved hexagonal packing of\n7 disks (k = 1, m(1)=1) is well known and the one of 19 disks (k = 2, m(2)=1)\nhas been previously conjectured to be optimal. New curved hexagonal packings of\n37, 61, and 91 disks (k = 3, 4, and 5, m(3)=1, m(4)=3, and m(5)=12) were the\ndensest we obtained on a computer using a so-called \"billiards\" simulation\nalgorithm. A curved hexagonal packing pattern is invariant under a 60 degree\nrotation. For k tending to infinity, the density (covering fraction) of curved\nhexagonal packings tends to pi*pi/12. The limit is smaller than the density of\nthe known optimum disk packing in the infinite plane. We found disk\nconfigurations that are denser than curved hexagonal packings for 127, 169, and\n217 disks (k = 6, 7, and 8). In addition to new packings for h(k) disks, we\npresent new packings we found for h(k)+1 and h(k)-1 disks for k up to 5, i.e.,\nfor 36, 38, 60, 62, 90, and 92 disks. The additional packings show the\n``tightness'' of the curved hexagonal pattern for k =< 5: deleting a disk does\nnot change the optimum packing and its quality significantly, but adding a disk\ncauses a substantial rearrangement in the optimum packing and substantially\ndecreases the quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2004 06:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
