Fortunately, the\nevolution of these clouds in the local potential has an analytical solution,\nthat can be used to evolve the whole system during a significant fraction of\ndynamical time. In the process, the clouds, initially round, change shape and\nget elongated. At some point, the system needs to be remapped on round clouds\nonce again. This remapping can be performed optimally using a small number of\nLucy iterations. The remapped solution can be evolved again with the cloud\nmethod, and the process can be iterated a large number of times without showing\nsignificant diffusion. Our numerical experiments show that it is possible to\nfollow the 2 dimensional phase space distribution during a large number of\ndynamical times with excellent accuracy. The main limitation to this accuracy\nis the finite size of the clouds, which results in coarse graining the\nstructures smaller than the clouds and induces small aliasing effects at these\nscales. However, it is shown in this paper that this method is consistent with\nan adaptive refinement algorithm which allows one to track the evolution of the\nfiner structure in phase space.

The reason of this\nfailure is a misunderstanding of the spectroscopy of hydrogen crossed by a\npowerful beam of short wavelengths light.

A\npowerful radio emission may produce an extra ionisation where the pressure is\nconvenient. The combination of Lyman absorptions and redshifts produces an\ninstability which chains Lyman absorption patterns : when a redshifted Lyman\nabsorbed line coincides with a Lyman line, all absorption lines of the gas are\nwritten into the spectrum. Thus all characteristics of the complex spectrum of\na quasar are generated, so that observed accretors are named quasars, and the\norigin of the intrinsic redshifts is found.

We argue that cooling should proceed via the formation of\nhigh-density, 10^4 K clouds, pressure-confined within a hot gas background. The\nbackground medium has a low density, and can survive as a stable corona with a\nlong cooling time. The fraction of baryons contained in the residual hot core\ngrows with halo mass because the cooling density increases, and this leads to\nan upper-mass limit in quiescent, non-merged galaxies of ~10^11 Msun.

In general we find that all impurities of the 5sp and 6sp\nseries in Si and Ge prefer the split-vacancy configuration, with an energy gain\nof 0.5 to 1 eV compared to the substitutional complex. On the other hand,\nimpurities of the 3sp and 4sp series form a (slightly distorted) substitutional\ncomplex. Al impurities show an exception from this rule, forming a split\ncomplex in Si and a strongly distorted substitutional complex in Ge. We find a\nstrong correlation of these data with the size of the isolated impurities,\nbeing defined via the lattice relaxations of the nearest neighbors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2004 16:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

We find that the nuclear modification factor which quantifies the\ndegree of suppression, is almost pT-independent both for RHIC (in agreement\nwith data) and for the LHC. This is a consequence of the shape of the partonic\npT-spectrum in elementary collisions which implies that for the same value of\nthe nuclear modification factor at higher pT, an increasingly smaller fraction\nof parton energy loss is needed. When the values of the time-averaged transport\ncoefficient exceed 5 GeV^2/fm, the nuclear modification factor gradually loses\nits sensitivity to the corresponding produced energy density.

For example, the truncation of the\nlight-cone Fock space leads to uncompensated ultraviolet divergences.

In the latter case, which is applicable to light-cone gauge (A^+ =\n0), the A^- component of the gauge field is maintained as an independent degree\nof freedom rather than a constraint. Finite-mass Pauli-Villars regulators can\nalso be used to compensate for neglected higher Fock states.
