In particular, such\nexpansions can produce iron-group nuclides, p-process nuclei, or even heavy,\nneutron-rich isotopes. Such diversity arises because the nucleosynthesis enters\na little explored regime in which the free nucleons are not in equilibrium with\nthe abundant alpha particles. This allows nuclei significantly heavier than\niron to form in t he presence of abundant free nucleons early in the expansion.\nAs the temperature drops, nucleons increasingly assemble into alpha particles\nand heavier nuclei. If the assembly is efficient, the resulting depletion of\nfree neutrons allows disintegrat ion flows to drive nuclei back down to iron\nand nickel. If this assembly is inefficient, then the large abundance of free\nnucleons prevents the disintegration flows and leaves a distribution of heavy\nnuclei after reaction freezeout. For cases in between, an intermediate\nabundance distribution, enriched in p-process isotopes, is frozen out. These\nlast expansions may contribute to the solar system's supply of the p-process\nnuclides if mildly proton-rich, high-entropy matter is ejected from\nproto-neutron stars winds or other astrophysical sites.

We estimate this object to be an additional\nembedded object with a dense dust shell. Very near the HMC location we find L'\nband emission which strongly rises in flux towards longer wavelengths.

It is\nshown that the causal geometry of such a quantum space-time possesses a rich\nhierarchical structure. The natural extension of the Poincare group to quantum\nspace-time is investigated. In particular, we prove that the symmetry group of\na quantum space-time is generated in general by a system of irreducible Killing\ntensors. When the symmetries of a quantum space-time are spontaneously broken,\nthen the points of the quantum space-time can be interpreted as space-time\nvalued operators. The generic point of a quantum space-time in the broken\nsymmetry phase thus becomes a Minkowski space-time valued operator. Classical\nspace-time emerges as a map from quantum space-time to Minkowski space. It is\nshown that the general such map satisfying appropriate causality-preserving\nconditions ensuring linearity and Poincare invariance is necessarily a density\nmatrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2004 11:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Over the last years, the eta meson has been studied at several\ndifferent experiments mainly by measurements of unpolarized total and\ndifferential cross sections. To reveal the production mechanism, polarization\nobservables help to disentangle the amplitudes of the partial waves and\ntherefore to understand the underlying exchange processes. Analyzing powers\nhave been measured enabling to separate the contributing amount of some of\nthese amplitudes. Double polarization observables will widen the number of\naccessible amplitudes and hence give further constraints to the theoretical\nmodels. Due to the trigonometric symmetries in polarization measurements, a\nsymmetric detector geometry in the azimuthal angle is preferable. The WASA\ndetector with its 4-pi geometry for neutral and charged particles together with\nthe use of a frozen spin target should therefore allow to study double\npolarization observables not only in vec{p}vec{p} but also in vec{p}vec{d} or\nvec{d}vec{p} collisions.

Recently, experiments on mRNA abundance (gene expression) have\nrevealed that gene expression shows a stationary organization described by a\npower-law distribution (scale-free organization) (i.e., gene expression $k$\ndecays as $k^{-\\gamma}$), which is highly conserved in all the major five\nkingdoms of life, from Bacteria to Human. An underlying gene expression\ndynamics \"rich-travel-more\" was suggested to recover that evolutional\nconservation of transcriptional organization. Here we propose a constructive\napproach to gene expression dynamics with larger scope. Our gene expression\nconstruction restores the stationary state, predicts the power-law exponent for\ndifferent organisms with natural explanation for small correction at high and\nlow expression levels, describes the intermediate state dynamics (time finite)\nand elucidates the gene expression stability. This approach requires only one\nassumption: Markov property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2004 04:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The canonical momentum is uniquely defined as the operator that\ngenerates spatial translations in a uniform medium, but the quantization scheme\nsuggests two possible choices for the kinetic momentum operator, corresponding\nto the Abraham or the Minkowski momentum in classical electrodynamics. Another\nimplication of this procedure is that a wave packet containing a single dressed\nphoton travels at the group velocity through the medium. The physical\nsignificance of the canonical momentum has already been established by\nconsiderations of energy and momentum conservation in the atomic recoil due to\nspontaneous emission, the Cerenkov effect, the Doppler effect, and phase\nmatching in nonlinear optical processes. In addition, the data of the Jones and\nLeslie radiation pressure experiment is consistent with the assignment of one\n?k unit of canonical momentum to each dressed photon. By contrast, experiments\nin which the dielectric is rigidly accelerated by unbalanced electromagnetic\nforces require the use of the Abraham momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2004 19:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2004 18:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
