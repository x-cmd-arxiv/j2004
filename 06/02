We investigate two scenarios for the fast decaying early\noptical emission of these GRB afterglows. In the reverse-forward shock\nscenario, this emission arises in the reverse shock crossing the GRB ejecta,\nthe mitigation of the light-curve decay occurring when the forward shock\nemission overtakes that from the reverse shock. Both a homogeneous and\nwind-like circumburst medium are considered. In the wind-bubble scenario, the\nsteeply decaying, early optical emission arises from the forward shock\ninteracting with a 1/r^2 bubble, with a negligible contribution from the\nreverse shock, the slower decay starting when the blast wave reaches the bubble\ntermination shock and enters a homogeneous region of the circumburst medium.\n  We determine the shock microphysical parameters, ejecta kinetic energy, and\ncircumburst density which accommodate the radio and optical measurements of the\nGRB afterglows 990123 and 021211. We find that, for a homogeneous medium, the\nradio and optical emissions of the afterglow 990123 can be accommodated by the\nreverse-forward shock scenario if the microphysical parameters behind the two\nshocks differ substantially. A wind-like circumburst medium also allows the\nreverse-forward shocks scenario to account for the radio and optical properties\nof the afterglows 990123 and 021211, but the required wind densities are at\nleast 10 times smaller than those of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. The wind-bubble\nscenario requires a variation of the microphysical parameters when the\nafterglow fireball reaches the wind termination shock, which seems a contrived\nfeature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2004 16:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

By employing publicly available X-ray and\noptical data and catalogues we discover 68 type 2 AGN candidates. The X-ray\npowers of these sources are estimated by using a previously known correlation\nbetween X-ray luminosity and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. Thirty-one of our\ncandidates have high estimated powers (Lx > 10^44 erg/s) and therefore qualify\nas optically obscured quasars, the so-called ``QSO 2''. Based on the derived\nX-ray powers, our candidates are likely to be at relatively high redshifts, z ~\n3, with the QSO 2 at z ~ 4. By going ~ 3 magnitudes fainter than previously\nknown type 2 AGN in the two GOODS fields we are sampling a region of redshift -\npower space which was previously unreachable with classical methods. Our method\nbrings to 40 the number of QSO 2 in the GOODS fields, an improvement of a\nfactor ~ 4 when compared to the only 9 such sources previously known. We derive\na QSO 2 surface density down to 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5 - 8 keV band of >~\n330/deg^2, ~ 30% of which is made up of previously known sources. This is\nlarger than current estimates and some predictions and suggests that the\nsurface density of QSO 2 at faint flux limits has been underestimated. This\nwork demonstrates that VO tools are mature enough to produce cutting-edge\nscience results by exploiting astronomical data beyond ``classical''\nidentification limits (R <~ 25) with interoperable tools for statistical\nidentification of sources using multiwavelength information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2004 11:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The\nmain point of FGY, however, is to obtain a theory of neutrino masses with only\none possible CP violating angle. They argue that the sign of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe (assuming leptogenesis) is then correlated with CP\nasymmetries possibly observable in accelerator experiments. Unfortunately,\nthere is a fly in the ointment. It was later shown by Raidal and Strumia [RS]\nthat there is a sign ambiguity which frustrates the above correlation.

They are based on a continuous approximation of\npopulation dynamics. Four dynamical elements are required in this formulation:\nascendant matrix, transverse matrix, fitness function, and the stochastic\ndrive. The first law states that in the absence of stochastic drive the\nartificial life always seeks for a local fitness attractor and stay there. It\ngives the reference point to discuss the general evolutionary dynamics. The\nsecond law is explicitly expressed in a unique form of stochastic differential\nequation with all four dynamical elements. The third law defines the\nrelationship between the focused level of description to its lower and higher\nones, and also defines the dichotomy of deterministic and stochastic drives.\nThese laws provide a coherence framework to discuss several current problems,\nsuch as emergency and stability. In particular, two quantities are emphasized:\nthe fitness function as the standard for selection and the stochasticity as the\nsource of creativity. Those three laws may appear almost self-evident from a\nstatistical physics point of view.

It is shown beyond a shadow\nof a doubt that thermodynamics is a nonstatistical science that applies to all\nsystems (both macroscopic, and microscopic, including systems that consist\neither of only one structureless particle, or only one spin), to all states\n(both thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium), and\nthat includes entropy as a well defined, intrinsic, nonstatistical property of\nany system in any state, at any instant in time.

This is useful for both\nfundamental investigations such as the nature of the quantum-classical\ntransition as well as for applications such as quantum feedback control.

Here we\ndiscuss some consequences of the fact that when closed-system classical and\nquantum dynamics are treated in Gaussian approximation, they are in fact\nidentical. Thus, it follows that several results in the so-called `semiquantum'\nchaos actually arise from approximating the classical, and not the quantum\ndynamics. (Similarly, opposing claims of quantum suppression of chaos are also\nsuspect.) As a simple byproduct of the analysis we are able to show how the\nLyapunov exponent appears in the language of phase space distributions in a way\nthat clearly underlines the difference between quantum and classical dynamical\nsituations. We also informally discuss some aspects of approximations that go\nbeyond the Gaussian approximation, such as the issue of when quantum nonlinear\ndynamical corrections become important compared to nonlinear classical\ncorrections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2004 17:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
