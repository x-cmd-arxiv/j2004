After mapping out the phases of the `clean'\nstrong coupling problem, we focus on the effect of disorder at strong\nelectron-phonon (EP) coupling. The presence of even weak disorder (i)\nenormously enhances the resistivity (\\rho) at T=0, simultaneously suppressing\nthe density of states at the Fermi level, (ii) suppresses the temperature\ndependent increase of \\rho, and (iii) leads to a regime with d\\rho/dT <0. We\nlocate the origin of these anomalies in the disorder induced tendency towards\npolaron formation, and the associated suppression in effective carrier density\nand mobility. These results, explicitly at `metallic' density, are of direct\nrelevance to disordered EP materials like covalent semiconductors, the\nmanganites, and to anomalous transport in the A-15 compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2004 13:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 12:42:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2005 06:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We describe the\nresponse of free test masses to plane gravitational waves in the coordinate\nframe of a local observer and show that it acquires contributions from three\ndifferent effects: the displacement of the test masses, the apparent change in\nthe photon velocity, and the variation in the clock speed of the local\nobserver, all of which are induced by the gravitational wave. Only when taken\ntogether do these three effects represent a quantity which is translationally\ninvariant.

Taking a product of a large graph with a small\ngraph, the resulting graph inherits (roughly) its size from the large one, its\ndegree from the small one, and its expansion properties from both! Iteration\nyields simple explicit constructions of constant-degree expanders of arbitrary\nsize, starting from one constant-size expander.\n  Crucial to our intuition (and simple analysis) of the properties of this\ngraph product is the view of expanders as functions which act as ``entropy\nwave\" propagators -- they transform probability distributions in which entropy\nis concentrated in one area to distributions where that concentration is\ndissipated. In these terms, the graph products affords the constructive\ninterference of two such waves.\n  Subsequent work [ALW01], [MW01] relates the zig-zag product of graphs to the\nstandard semidirect product of groups, leading to new results and constructions\non expanding Cayley graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2004 16:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The extremal states in this set have recently been characterized by\nParthasarathy [Ann. Henri Poincar\\'e (to appear), quant-ph/0307182, [1]]. Here\nwe present an alternative necessary and sufficient condition for a state with\ngiven marginals to be extremal. Our approach is based on a canonical duality\nbetween bipartite states and a certain class of completely positive maps and\nhas the advantage that it is easier to check and to construct explicit examples\nof extremal states. In dimension 2 x 2 we give a simple new proof for the fact\nthat all extremal states with maximally mixed marginals are precisely the\nprojectors onto maximally entangled wave functions. We also prove that in\nhigher dimension this does not hold and construct an explicit example of an\nextremal state with maximally mixed marginals in dimension 3 x 3 that is not\nmaximally entangled. Generalizations of this result to higher dimensions are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2004 13:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
