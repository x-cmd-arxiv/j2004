The detailed nucleosynthetic yields of our explosion\nmodels are calculated by post-processing the ejecta, using passively advected\ntracer particles. The nuclear reaction network employed in computing the\nexplosive nucleosynthesis contains 383 nuclear species. We analyzed two\ndifferent choices of ignition conditions (centrally ignited, in which the\nspherical initial flame geometry is perturbated with toroidal rings, and\nbubbles, in which multi-point ignition conditions are simulated). We show that\nunburned C and O varies typically from ~40% to ~50% of the total ejected\nmaterial.The main differences between all our models and standard 1D\ncomputations are, besides the higher mass fraction of unburned C and O, the C/O\nratio (in our case is typically a factor of 2.5 higher than in 1D\ncomputations), and somewhat lower abundances of certain intermediate mass\nnuclei such as S, Cl, Ar, K, and Ca, and of 56Ni. Because explosive C and O\nburning may produce the iron-group elements and their isotopes in rather\ndifferent proportions one can get different 56Ni-fractions (and thus supernova\nluminosities) without changing the kinetic energy of the explosion. Finally, we\nshow that we need the high resolution multi-point ignition (bubbles) model to\nburn most of the material in the center (demonstrating that high resolution\ncoupled with a large number of ignition spots is crucial to get rid of unburned\nmaterial in a pure deflagration SNIa model).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2004 16:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper, we evaluate the gapless CFL phase, in several\nsenses. We present the details underlying our earlier work which showed how\nthis phase arises. We display all nine quasiparticle dispersion relations in\nfull detail. Using a general pairing ansatz that only neglects effects that are\nknown to be small, we perform a comparison of the free energies of the gCFL,\nCFL, 2SC, gapless 2SC, and 2SCus phases. We conclude that as density drops,\nmaking the CFL phase less favored, the gCFL phase is the next spatially uniform\nquark matter phase to occur. A mixed phase made of colored components would\nhave lower free energy if color were a global symmetry, but in QCD such a mixed\nphase is penalized severely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2004 19:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2004 18:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper we present a combinatorial description of the\naffine crystals B^{r,1} of type D_n^{(1)}. A statistic preserving bijection\nbetween crystal paths for these crystals and rigged configurations is given,\nthereby proving the fermionic formula in this case. This bijection reflects two\ndifferent methods to solve lattice models in statistical mechanics: the\ncorner-transfer-matrix method and the Bethe Ansatz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2004 05:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2004 06:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
