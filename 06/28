For i<26 mag, the radial distribution of UCD candidates is more\nconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the GC system of Abell\n1689. The UCD candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar to\nthat of Abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter by\nabout 2-3 mag.

The spectroscopic event is\nthought to occur when near periastron passages the stellar companion induces\nmuch higher mass loss rate from the primary star, and/or enters into a much\ndenser environment around the primary star. I find that enhanced mass loss rate\nduring periastron passages, if it occurs, might explain the high eccentricity\nof the system. However, there is not yet a good model to explain the presumed\nenhanced mass loss rate during periastron passages. In the region where the\nwinds from the two stars collide, a dense slow flow is formed, such that large\ndust grains may be formed. Unlike the case during the 19th century Great\nEruption, the companion does not accrete mass during most of its orbital\nmotion.

The importance of\nthe thermal physics has been clearly demonstrated for the formation of the\nfirst stars in the universe, where it is well understood and results in cooling\nto a characteristic minimum temperature at a preferred density, and hence in a\ncharacteristic scale for fragmentation. In present-day star-forming clouds, an\nanalogous situation may exist in that at low densities the temperature is\nexpected to decrease with increasing density, reaching a minimum when the gas\nbecomes thermally coupled to the dust and then rising slowly at higher\ndensities. A minimum temperature of about 5 K is predicted to occur at a\ndensity of the order of 10^(-18) g cm^(-3), and at this point the Jeans mass is\nabout 0.3 solar masses, similar to the mass at which the IMF peaks. If most of\nthe fragmentation in star-forming clouds occurs in filaments, as is suggested\nby many simulations as well as by observations, fragmentation seems likely to\noccur preferentially at the density where the temperature reaches a minimum,\nand the Jeans mass at this point may then determine a characteristic scale for\nfragmentation and hence a preferred stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2004 15:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2004 20:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

These formulas were\nactually derived already around 1927 by Darwin, using the classical picture of\nangular momentum, and presented in their proper quantum-mechanical form in 1933\nby Bethe, although without any proof. The expressions have since been more or\nless lost from the literature; instead, the conventional treatment nowadays is\nto present only the approximations for weak and strong fields, respectively.\nHowever, in fusion research and other plasma physics applications, the magnetic\nfields applied to control the shape and position of the plasma span the entire\nregion from weak to strong fields, and there is a need for a unified treatment.\nIn this paper we present the detailed quantum-mechanical derivation of the\nexact eigenenergies and eigenstates of hydrogen-like atoms and ions in a static\nmagnetic field. Notably, these formulas are not much more complicated than the\nbetter-known approximations. Moreover, the derivation allows the value of the\nelectron spin gyromagnetic ratio $g_s$ to be different from 2. For\ncompleteness, we then review the details of dipole transitions between two\nhydrogenic levels, and calculate the corresponding Zeeman spectrum. The various\napproximations made in the derivation are also discussed in details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2004 10:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-04"}

The output factors obtained with our model agree\nwithin the statistical uncertainties with those calculated with the same Monte\nCarlo codes and with those measured with different techniques. Owing to the\naccuracy of the results obtained and to the reduction in the computational time\nwith respect to full geometry simulations (larger than a factor 15), this\nsimplified model opens the possibility to use Monte Carlo tools for planning\npurposes in the Gamma Knife$^{\\circledR}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2004 14:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The additional fourth atomic state is\ncoupled by a strong coupling laser field to the usual three-level setup of\nsingle-EIT cooling. This effectively allows to create two EIT structures in the\nabsorption spectrum of the system to be cooled, which may be controlled by the\ncoupling laser field parameters to cancel both the carrier- and the\nblue-sideband excitations. In leading order of the Lamb-Dicke expansion, this\nsuppresses all heating processes.
