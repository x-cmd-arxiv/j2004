The average relative dispersion in\nredshift distribution is ~8%, among the most accurate for photometric surveys.\nThe high reliability of our results is attributable to the high quality and\nbroad coverage of data as well as the applications of several independent\nmethods and a careful evaluation of every source.

X-ray luminosities of the detected\nsources in the 0.5-10 keV band are in the range of log LX ~30-32 ergs s-1,\nwhich is systematically higher than those of low-mass PMSs. This fact suggests\nthat the contribution of a possible low-mass companion is not large.

These flare shapes are similar to those of\nlow-mass PMSs. The X-ray spectra are successfully reproduced by an absorbed one\nor two-temperature thin-thermal plasma model. The temperatures are in the range\nof kT ~1-5 keV, which are significantly higher than those of main-sequence OB\nstars (kT < 1 keV). These X-ray properties are not explained by wind driven\nshocks, but are more likely due to magnetic activity. On the other hand, the\nplasma temperature rises as absorption column density increases, or as HAeBes\nascend to earlier phases. The X-ray luminosity reduces after stellar age of a\nfew x10^6 years. X-ray activity may be related to stellar evolution. The age of\nthe activity decay is apparently near the termination of jet or outflow\nactivity.

A","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We examine the conditions in favor and necessity of a realistic multileveled\ndescription of a decohering quantum system. Under these conditions approximate\ntechniques to simplify a multileveled system by its first two levels is\nunreliable and a realistic multilevel description in the formulation of\ndecoherence is unavoidable. In this regard, our first crucial observation is\nthat, the validity of the two level approximation of a multileveled system is\nnot controlled purely by {\\it sufficiently low temperatures}. We demonstrate\nusing three different environmental spectral models that the type of\nsystem-environment coupling and the environmental spectrum have a dominant role\nover the temperature. Particularly, zero temperature quantum fluctuations\ninduced by the Caldeira-Leggett type linear coordinate coupling can be\ninfluential in a wide energy range in the systems allowed transitions. The\nsecond crucial observation against the validity of the two level approximation\nis that the decoherence times being among the system's short time scales are\nfound to be dominated not by the resonant but {\\it non-resonant} processes. We\ndemonstrate this in three stages. Firstly, our zero temperature numerical\ncalculations reveal that, the calculated decoherence rates including\nrelaxation, dephasing and leakage phenomena show, a linear dependence on the\nspectral area for all spectral models used, independent from the spectral shape\nwithin a large environmental spectral range compared to the quantum system's\nenergies. Secondly, within the same range, the decoherence times only have a\nmarginal dependence on the translations of the entire frequency spectrum.\nFinally, the same decoherence rates show strong dependence on the number of\ncoupled levels by the system-environment coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2004 14:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
