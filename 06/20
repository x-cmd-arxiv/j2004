The contemporary theory of the expansion of the universe (Big\nBang) requires in addition to the Hubble constant several adjustable\nparameters, such as an initial explosion, the dark matter parameter, and a time\nadjustable dark energy parameter for explaining the supernova Ia data. The\ncontemporary Big Bang theory also requires time dilation of distant events as\nan inherent premise. The contention is usually that the light curves of distant\nsupernovas show or even prove the time dilation. In the present article, we\nchallenge this assertion.

Light from the\nmain component of the supernova (which we call the bulk supernova for short)\nscatters off electrons in the jets and is polarized: this polarized light is\nadded to the direct emission from the bulk supernova and causes the overall\nsupernova emission to be polarized. The motivation for the bipolar jet model is\nto resolve the potential paradox set by an analysis which suggests strong\nspherical symmetry for Type Ib supernovae and the expectation that Type Ib\nsupernovae should be highly polarized in the continuum up to perhaps about 4 %.\nFor the model we have derived simple, non-relativistic, approximate analytic\nformulae for relative amount of scattered flux and polarization. The\npolarization formula qualitatively reproduces two main features observed for at\nleast some supernovae: (1) the rise to a polarization maximum and then decline\nwith time; (2) the inverted P Cygni polarization profiles of lines. The model\nis strictly axisymmetric and predicts a constant position angle of intrinsic\npolarization. Since position angle variation of intrinsic polarization is\nobserved, the model cannot account for all the polarization of all supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2004 04:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It gives a theoretical framework to reformulate the matrix model as\nquantum mechanics of $D_0$ branes in a Lorentz-covariant form. The so-called\nkinetic term ($\\sim {\\hat{P_i}}^2)$ and potential term ($\\sim\n{[\\hat{X_i},\\hat{X_j}]}^2)$ of $D_0$ branes in the matrix model are described\nnow in terms of Casimir operator of $SO(D,1)$, a subalgebra of the primary\nalgebra $SO(D+1,1)$ which underlies YSTA with two contraction- parameters,\n$\\lambda$ and $R$. $D$-dimensional noncommutative space-time and momentum\noperators $\\hat{X_\\mu}$ and $\\hat{P_\\mu}$ in YSTA show a distinctive spectral\nstructure, that is, space-components $\\hat{X_i}$ and $\\hat{P_i}$ have discrete\neigenvalues, and time-components $\\hat{X_0}$ and $\\hat{P_0}$ continuous\neigenvalues, consistently with Lorentz-covariance. According to the method of\nLorentz-covariant Moyal star product proper to YSTA, the field equation of\n$D_0$ brane on YSTA is derived in a nontrivial form beyond simple Klein-Gordon\nequation, which reflects the noncommutative space-time structure of YSTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2004 05:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
