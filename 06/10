The values are in\nagreement with results from radar data, visual and near-IR observations. In\nthis first comparison between these two model approaches we found that the\nempirical NEATM beaming parameter $\\eta$=1.0 corresponds to a thermal inertia\nvalues of about 100 $\\mathrm{J m^{-2} s^{-0.5} K^{-1}}$ for a typical range of\nsurface roughness, assuming an equator-on viewing angle. Our TPM analysis\nindicated that the surface of 2002 NY40 consists of rocky material with a thin\nor no dust regolith. The asteroid very likely has a prograde sense of rotation\nwith a cold terminator at the time of our observations.

The response of dark matter to\nthe condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabatic\ncontraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. In contrast,\nhalos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple\nviolent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos\nare highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner\nregions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations which include\ngas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. We find that the\ndissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens its\nradial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case without\ncooling. For the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model in\ncosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematically\noverpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5% of the virial\nradius.

A conventional model plus hard\nsources in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the\nGeV excess away from the Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection\nspectrum are inconsistent with the local spectrum even considering the expected\nfluctuations; they are also inconsistent with the EGRET data above 10 GeV.\n  We present a new model which fits the spectrum in all sky regions adequately.\nSecondary antiproton data were used to fix the Galactic average proton\nspectrum, while the electron spectrum is adjusted using the spectrum of diffuse\nemission itself. The derived electron and proton spectra are compatible with\nthose measured locally considering fluctuations due to energy losses,\npropagation, or possibly details of Galactic structure. This model requires a\nmuch less dramatic variation in the electron spectrum than models with a hard\nelectron injection spectrum, and moreover it fits the gamma-ray spectrum better\nand to the highest EGRET energies. It gives a good representation of the\nlatitude distribution of the gamma-ray emission from the plane to the poles,\nand of the longitude distribution.

Observations of H2, [Fe II] and [C I] are\nused to constrain shock model parameters and determine the origin of the\nemission. Previous work has shown that it is likely that the atomic and ionic\nemission arises in regions of higher ionization than the molecular emission. On\nthe basis of observations, it has often been suggested that the [Fe II] and [C\nI] emission could arise, for example, at the apex of a bow shock, with the H2\nemission produced in the wings. Accordingly, we have combined models of\nC-component and J-type shocks in order to reproduce the observed H2, [Fe II]\nand [C I] line spectra. We can account for the H2 emission towards the HH99B\ncomplex by means of J-type shocks with magnetic precursors.

We show that the spin wave\nexcitation in the AFLRO state at half-filling evolves into a resonancelike peak\nat a finite energy in the superconducting state, which is located around the AF\nwave vectors. The width of such a resonancelike peak in momentum space decides\na spin correlation length scale which is inversely proportional to the square\nroot of doping concentration, while the energy of the resonancelike peak scales\nlinearly with the doping concentration at low doping. An important prediction\nof the theory is that, while the total spin sum rule is satisfied at different\ndoping concentrations, the weight of the resonancelike peak does not vanish,\nbut is continuously saturated to the weight of the AFLRO at zero-doping limit.\nBesides the low-energy resonancelike peak, we also show that the high-energy\nexcitations still track the spin wave dispersion in momentum space,\ncontributing to a significant portion of the total spin sum rule.

Here we investigate the effect of the LISA transfer\nfunction on detection and parameter estimation for monochromatic sources. For\nsignal detection we show that filters constructed by approximating the transfer\nfunction as a constant (long wavelength approximation) introduce a negligible\nloss of signal-to-noise ratio -- the fitting factor always exceeds 0.97 -- for\nf below 10mHz, therefore in a frequency range where one would actually expect\nthe approximation to fail. For parameter estimation, we conclude that in the\nrange 3mHz to 30mHz the errors associated with parameter measurements differ\nfrom about 5% up to a factor of 10 (depending on the actual source parameters\nand emission frequency) with respect to those computed using the long\nwavelength approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 11:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2004 13:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In this paper, we focus on\nimproving and expanding this analytic framework for studying lipid-protein\ninteractions with special attention to MscL. Our goal is to generate simple\nscaling relations which can be used to provide qualitative understanding of the\nrole of membrane mechanics in protein function and to quantitatively interpret\nexperimental results.

One area that has\nbeen a beneficiary of these experimental techniques is the study of viruses. In\nthis paper we describe how the insights obtained from such experiments can be\nutilized to construct physical models of processes in the viral life cycle. We\nfocus on dsDNA bacteriophages and show that the bending elasticity of DNA and\nits electrostatics in solution can be combined to determine the forces\nexperienced during packaging and ejection of the viral genome. Furthermore, we\nquantitatively analyze the effect of fluid viscosity and capsid expansion on\nthe forces experienced during packaging. Finally, we present a model for DNA\nejection from bacteriophages based on the hypothesis that the energy stored in\nthe tightly packed genome within the capsid leads to its forceful ejection. The\npredictions of our model can be tested through experiments in vitro where DNA\nejection is inhibited by the application of external osmotic pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2004 00:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
