The expression for energy radiated\nconsists of two terms in this case. One of them, the larger one in the limit of\nlarge numbers of Bosons in the state, is proportional to the number of bosons\nsquared and has the same form as one obtains in a hydrodynamic model of quantum\nwave mechanics. This term is sensitive to the size and shape of the wave packet\nespecially when the force field causing acceleration is localized in extent.\nThe second term, identical to the single particle scattering formula, is less\nsensitive to the wave packet size and shape and is proportional to the number\nof bosons in the condensate. The conclusion is that for a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate the radiated bremsstrahlung is a sensitive function of the wave\npacket shape which is quite different than for a beam of incoherent particles\nwhich do not show very much dependence on the wave packet. Only lowest order\nradiation is calculated. It is also found that to lowest order there does not\nexist any situation in which the radiation loss from a coherent state of bosons\nvanishes completely, so that there is no analog of superconductivity in a\nparticle beam of this type at least within the net of assumptions made in this\npaper. The amount of radiation can be greatly suppressed however, as it is a\nsensitive function of the form of the wave function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2004 10:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
