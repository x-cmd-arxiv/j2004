The domain wall motion was analyzed\nboth in the context of stochastic nucleation in a periodic potential as well as\nthe canonical creep motion of an elastic manifold in a disorder potential.

To investigate the effects of changing the disorder\nin the films, defects were introduced during crystal growth (a-axis inclusions)\nor by heavy ion irradiation, producing films with planar and columnar defects,\nrespectively. The presence of these defects was found to significantly decrease\nthe creep exponent mu, from 0.62 - 0.69 to 0.38 - 0.5 in the irradiated films\nand 0.19 - 0.31 in the films containing a-axis inclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2004 14:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-07"}

As in many fluid flow\nsituations, the downstream flow (the convection and drift to the dayside) is an\nimportant boundary condition for the upstream flow (reconnection and inflow\nfrom the tail). Tail-like flux tubes in the near-earth plasma sheet block\ninflow from the tail between reconnection events. However, the westward drift\nof the energetic ions (curvature and gradient drift and ExB drift) removes\nplasma energy from near midnight causing deflation and earthward flow in the\nequatorial plane. (The process can be described as the westward drift of the\neastern of the plasma sheet / partial ring current.) The earthward flow removes\nmagnetic flux and plasma from the center of the thick plasma sheet and creates\na thin current sheet, which, in turn, favors the onset of reconnection. The X\nline forms just tailward of the earthward-flow region. Initially, reconnection\noccurs by the earthward propagation of the X line and the growth of a magnetic\nisland on its tailward side, since there is no downtail flow. Subsequently, the\nsystem evolves towards lobe merging, and the X line propagates tailward\nconsistent with the standard picture of tail reconnection. The east-west width\nof the local-time slot in which inflow and reconnection occur is determined by\nthe scale-length of the decrease in plasma energy at the eastern end of the\ndrifting ions. It is expected that the reconnection slot follows the westward\ndrift of the eastern end of the partial ring current.
