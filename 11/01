The model implements most of the relevant\nphysics governing these processes, such as the inhomogeneous IGM density\ndistribution, three different sources of ionizing photons (PopIII stars, PopII\nstars and QSOs), and radiative feedback. By constraining the free parameters\nwith available data on redshift evolution of Lyman-limit systems, Gunn-Peterson\nand electron scattering optical depths, Near InfraRed Background (NIRB), and\ncosmic star formation history, we select a fiducial model, whose main\npredictions are: (i) H was completely reionized at z \\approx 15, while HeII\nmust have been reionized by z \\approx 12.

(iii) Following reionization, the\ntemperature of the IGM corresponding to the mean gas density is boosted to\n15000 K.

However, Wall Friction(WF), the standard version of nuclear friction\nwhen incorporated in the Langevin dynamical model was not able to reproduce\nsimultaneously experimental data for both prescission neutron multiplicity and\nfission probability. Consequently, an empirical reduction in the strength of\nthe wall friction was found necessary to reproduce the experimental numbers by\nmany workers. Interestingly, a modification of the wall friction was proposed\nrecently where the reduction was achieved microscopically. This modified\nversion is known as the chaos weighted wall friction(CWWF) which takes into\naccount non-integrability of single particle motion. The work in my thesis aims\nat using this strongly shape dependent version of friction (CWWF) in the\nLangevin dynamical model coupled with particle and gamma evaporation in order\nto verify to what extent it can account for the experimental data of fission of\nhot nuclei. The experimental data includes excitation functions of prescission\nneutron multiplicity, fission probability as well as evaporation residue\ncross-section of a number of nuclei.
