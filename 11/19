An inhomogeneous mode of sliding occurs, when the driving\nvelocity is prescribed instead of the external stress. A transition to\nhomogeneous sliding occurs at a critical velocity, which is related to the\ncritical stress. We solve the elastic problem for a steady-state motion of a\nperiodic stick-slip pattern and derive equations of motion for the tip and\nresticking end of the slip pulses. In the slip regions we use the linear\nviscous friction law and do not assume any intrinsic instabilities even at\nsmall sliding velocities.

Based on a simple model of\nsupply networks, we offer an interpretation of instabilities and oscillations\nobserved in biological, ecological, economic, and engineering systems.\n  We find that most supply networks display damped oscillations, even when\ntheir units - and linear chains of these units - behave in a non-oscillatory\nway. Moreover, networks of damped oscillators tend to produce growing\noscillations. This surprising behavior offers, for example, a new\ninterpretation of business cycles and of oscillating or pulsating processes.\nThe network structure of material flows itself turns out to be a source of\ninstability, and cyclical variations are an inherent feature of decentralized\nadjustments. In particular, we show how to treat production and supply networks\nas transport problems governed by balance equations and equations for the\nadaptation of production speeds.\n  The stability and dynamic behavior of supply networks is investigated for\ndifferent topologies, including sequential supply chains, \"supply circles\",\n\"supply ladders\", and \"supply hierarchies\".

Two types of scaling problem arise: physical\nand computational. Physical scaling concerns how to relate simulation\nparameters to those of the real world. To do this effectively requires careful\nphysics, because (in common with other methods) lattice Boltzmann cannot fully\nresolve the hierarchy of length, energy and time scales that arise in typical\nflows of complex fluids. Care is needed in deciding what physics to resolve and\nwhat to leave unresolved, particularly when colloidal particles are present in\none or both of two fluid phases. This influences steering of simulation\nparameters such as fluid viscosity and interfacial tension. When the physics is\nanisotropic (for example, in systems under shear) careful adaptation of the\ngeometry of the simulation box may be needed; an example of this, relating to\nour study of the effect of colloidal particles on the Rayleigh-Plateau\ninstability of a fluid cylinder, is described. The second and closely related\nset of scaling issues are computational in nature: how do you scale up\nsimulations to very large lattice sizes? The problem is acute for systems\nundergoing shear flow. Here one requires a set of blockwise co-moving frames to\nthe fluid, each connected to the next by a Lees-Edwards like boundary\ncondition.

The conflicting\ngoals of providing faster but computationally expensive processing call for new\napproaches in designing routers.\n  This survey takes a look at the core functionalities, like packet\nclassification, buffer memory management, switch scheduling and output link\nscheduling performed by a router in its data path processing and discusses the\nalgorithms that aim to reduce the performance bound for these operations. An\nimportant requirement for the routers is to provide Quality of Service\nguarantees.

Apart from the\ntracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either\nto steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator\nabout the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality\nmeasure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated\nobservations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could\nbe the Kullback-Leibler difference.\n  We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some\nterrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and \"meta-sensors\"\nwith force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different\nsize. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle\nfilters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their\nsub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of\nthose sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.\n  Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior\nPHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to\nthree or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a\nmapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on\ndoctrine knowledge of unit configuration.\n  The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using\nsome measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a\nbounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a\ndiscretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the\nmeasure locally to different parts of the space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2004 13:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The first part of the\nthesis is devoted to the medium modifications of the Dalitz decays from the\nomega and rho mesons in nuclear matter. We use the relativistic field theory\nformalism describing modifications of the coupling by one-loop Feynman diagrams\nwith nucleons and Delta(1232) isobars. We consider cases when the decaying\nparticle is at rest or at motion with respect to the medium. We investigate the\ndependence of medium effects on the dilepton invariant mass and observe a\nsizeable increase of the effective coupling constants compared to their vacuum\nvalues. The effect grows with density. In the second part of the thesis we\napply our model to evaluate the influence of the medium effects on the dilepton\nproduction from the Dalitz decays. In the calculations of the dilepton spectrum\nwe use the model of the hydrodynamic expansion of the fire cylinder. In our\ncomparison to the CERES dilepton data we take into account the experimental\ncuts. The medium modifications enhance the effect of the Dalitz decays.

This enables us to extend to the electromagnetic field the exact\nmethod of state construction proposed previously for spin 0 systems, in which\nthe time-dependent wavefunction is computed from a single-valued continuum of\ndeterministic trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a\nsingle orbit. The deduction of Maxwell\\s equations from continuum mechanics is\nachieved by generalizing the spin 0 theory to a general Riemannian manifold\nfrom which the electromagnetic construction is extracted as a special case. In\nparticular, the flat-space Maxwell equations are represented as a curved-space\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for a massive system. The Lorentz covariance of the\nEulerian field theory is obtained from the non-covariant Lagrangian-coordinate\nmodel as a kind of collective effect. The method makes manifest the\nelectromagnetic analogue of the quantum potential that is tacit in Maxwell\\s\nequations. This implies a novel definition of the \\classical limit\\ of\nMaxwell\\s equations that differs from geometrical optics. It is shown that\nMaxwell\\s equations may be obtained by canonical quantization of the classical\nmodel. Using the classical trajectories a novel expression is derived for the\npropagator of the electromagnetic field in the Eulerian picture. The trajectory\nand propagator methods of solution are illustrated for the case of a light\nwave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2004 23:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 10:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

This is called the quantum Zeno\neffect (QZE) or the anti-Zeno effect (AZE), depending on whether the decay is\nsuppressed or enhanced. In conventional theories of the QZE and AZE, effects of\nmeasurements are simply described by the projection postulate, assuming that\neach measurement is an instantaneous and ideal one. However, real measurements\nare not instantaneous and ideal. For the QZE and AZE by such general\nmeasurements, interesting and surprising features have recently been revealed,\nwhich we review in this article. The results are based on the quantum\nmeasurement theory, which is also reviewed briefly. As a typical model, we\nconsider a continuous measurement of the decay of an excited atom by a\nphotodetector that detects a photon emitted from the atom upon decay. This\nmeasurement is an indirect negative-result one, for which the curiosity of the\nQZE and AZE is emphasized. It is shown that the form factor is renormalized as\na backaction of the measurement, through which the decay dynamics is modified.\nIn a special case of the flat response, where the detector responds to every\nphoton mode with an identical response time, results of the conventional\ntheories are reproduced qualitatively. However, drastic differences emerge in\ngeneral cases where the detector responds only to limited photon modes. For\nexample, against predictions of the conventional theories, the QZE or AZE may\ntake place even for states that exactly follow the exponential decay law. We\nalso discuss relation to the cavity quantum electrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2004 07:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2005 06:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
