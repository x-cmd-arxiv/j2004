This requirement places constraints on the\ncosmological formation of SMBHs, believed to grow from smaller initial seeds by\na combination of accretion and mergers. We focus on gas accretion onto seeds\nproduced by the collapse of Pop III stars at high redshift. We incorporate the\nresults of recent relativistic, MHD simulations of disk accretion onto Kerr\nblack holes to track the coupled evolution of the masses and spins of the\nholes. We allow for an additional amplification of ~10^4 in the mass of a\ntypical seed due to mergers, consistent with recent Monte Carlo simulations of\nhierarchical mergers of cold, dark matter halos containing black hole seeds. We\nfind that the growth of Pop III black hole seeds to ~10^9 M_sun by z_QSO = 6.43\nfavors MHD accretion disks over standard thin disks. MHD disks tend to drive\nthe holes to a submaximal equilibrium spin rate a/M ~ 0.95 and radiation\nefficiency epsilon_M ~ 0.2, while standard thin disks drive them to maximal\nspin (a/M = 1) and efficiency (epsilon_M = 0.42). This small difference in\nefficiency results in a huge difference in mass amplification by accretion at\nthe Eddington limit. The MHD equilibrium efficiency is consistent with the\nobserved ratio of the QSO plus AGN luminosity density to the local SMBH mass\ndensity. Our prototype analysis is designed to stimulate the incorporation of\nresults from relativistic stellar collapse and MHD accretion simulations in\nfuture Monte Carlo simulations of hierarchical structure formation to better\ndetermine the cosmological role of SMBHs and their mass and spin distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2004 21:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In early studies of this model it was found that there is\na critical value of g^2, the square of the renormalized coupling constant,\nabove which g_0^2, the square of the unrenormalized coupling constant, is\nnegative. Thus, for g^2 larger than this critical value, the Hamiltonian of the\nLee model becomes non-Hermitian. It was also discovered that in this\nnon-Hermitian regime a new state appears whose norm is negative. This state is\ncalled a ghost state. It has always been assumed that in this ghost regime the\nLee model is an unacceptable quantum theory because unitarity appears to be\nviolated. However, in this regime while the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, it\ndoes possess PT symmetry. It has recently been discovered that a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian having PT symmetry may define a quantum theory that is unitary.
