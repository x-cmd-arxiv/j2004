Driven by GR reaction, sparsely, the binary separation\nreduces, the WD overflows its Roche lobe and the mass transfer drives unstable\nthe accretion disk around the NS. As the binary circular orbital period is a\nmultiple integer number ($m$) of the period of the WD fundamental mode (Pons et\nal. 2002), the WD is since long pulsating at its fundamental mode; and most of\nits harmonics, due to the tidal interaction with its NS orbital companion.\nHence, when the powerful irradiation glows onto the WD; from the fireball\nejected as part of the disk matter slumps onto the NS, it is partially\nabsorbed.

After each mass-transfer episode the binary\nseparation (and orbital period) is augmented significantly (Deloye & Bildsten\n2003; Al\\'ecyan & Morsink 2004) due to the binary's angular momentum\nredistribution.

Based on the\nultra-relativistic, ultracompact X-ray binary model introduced in the\naccompanying paper (Mosquera Cuesta 2004a), I present here a self-consistent\nexplanation for such an striking feature. I suggest that both the fundamental\nmode and the overtones observed in SGR1900+14 stem from pulsations of a massive\nwhite dwarf (WD). The fundamental mode (and likely some of its harmonics) is\nexcited because of the mutual gravitational interaction with its orbital\ncompanion (a NS, envisioned here as point mass object) whenever the binary\nKeplerian orbital frequency is a multiple integer number ($m$) of that mode\nfrequency (Pons et al. 2002). Besides, a large part of the powerful irradiation\nfrom the fireball-like explosion occurring on the NS (after partial accretion\nof disk material) is absorbed in different regions of the star driving the\nexcitation of other multipoles (Podsiadlowski 1991,1995), i.e., the overtones\n(fluid modes of higher frequency). Part of this energy is then reemitted into\nspace from the WD surface or atmosphere. This way, the WD lightcurve carries\nwith it the signature of these pulsations inasmuch the way as it happens with\nthe Sun pulsations in Helioseismology. It is shown that our theoretical\nprediction on the pulsation spectrum agrees quite well with the one found by\nBeppoSAX (Feroci et al. 1999).

In this contribution, we confront Eggen's hypothesis that they are\ncluster remnants with the results of a kinematic analysis of more than 6000 K\nand M giants in the solar neighbourhood. This analysis includes new radial\nvelocity data from a large survey performed with the Coravel spectrometer,\ncomplemented by Hipparcos parallaxes and Tycho-2 proper motions (Famaey et al.\n2004). A maximum-likelihood method, based on a bayesian approach, has been\napplied to the data, in order to make full use of all the available data\n(including less precise parallaxes) and to derive the properties of the\ndifferent kinematic subgroups. Two such subgroups can be identified with the\nHyades and Sirius superclusters. Stars belonging to them span a very wide range\nof age, which is difficult to account for in Eggen's scenario. These groups are\nthus most probably \"dynamical streams\" related to the dynamical perturbation by\nspiral waves rather than to cluster remnants.\n  In this scenario, the Hyades and Ursa Major clusters just happen to be in the\nHyades and Sirius streams, which are purely dynamical features that have\nnothing to do with the remnants of more massive primordial clusters. This\nmechanism could be the key to understanding the presence of an old metal-rich\npopulation, and of many exoplanetary systems in our neighbourhood. Moreover, a\nstrong spiral pattern seems to be needed in order to yield such prominent\nstreams. Since spiral structure is usually baryonic, this would leave very\nlittle room for dark matter. This may be an indication that the era of the\ndark-matter paradigm explaining the dynamics of the Galaxy may come to an end,\nand is being superseded by modified gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Nov 2004 13:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The metal leads may or may not be ferromagnetic, they are assumed\nto weakly couple to the QD region. Our theory is formulated by second\nquantizing the Rashba spin-orbital interaction in spectral space (instead of\nreal space), and quantum transport is then analyzed within the Keldysh\nnonequilibrium Green's function formalism. The Rashba interaction causes two\nmain effects to the Hamiltonian: (i) it gives rise to an extra spin-dependent\nphase factor in the coupling matrix elements between the leads and the QD; (ii)\nit gives rise to an inter-level spin-flip term but forbids any intra-level\nspin-flips.
