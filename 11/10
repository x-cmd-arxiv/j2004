I describe FUSE's contributions in four major areas: 1)\nthe Local Interstellar Medium (LISM), 2) the hot phase (O VI), 3) the cold\nphase (H_2), and 4) interstellar gas abundances. I devote particular attention\nto the common themes of ISM phase interactions and changes with metallicity. As\na whole, these results show that FUSE is the most powerful machine ever to\naddress problems of the ISM, and that FUSE points vividly to the future of ISM\nstudies in the Galaxy, Local Group, and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 22:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Read-out of single spin states has been achieved using optical\ntechniques, and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy.\nHowever, electrical read-out of single spins has so far remained elusive. Here,\nwe demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an individual\nelectron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. We use spin-to-charge conversion\nof a single electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron charge\nusing a quantum point contact; the spin measurement visibility is ~65%.\nFurthermore, we observe very long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to\n0.85 ms at a magnetic field of 8 Tesla), which are encouraging for the use of\nelectron spins as carriers of quantum information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 16:14:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2004 09:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For about 30 years CP violation could be described by a\nsingle number; this has changed dramatically in the years around the turn of\nthe millenium: (i) The existence of {\\em direct} CP violation was unequivocally\nestablished in the decays of long lived kaons. (ii) For the first time CP\nviolation was observed in a system other than that of neutral kaons, namely in\n$B\\to \\psi K_S$. The findings are in impressive agreement with the prediction\nof the CKM ansatz, which thus has been promoted to the status of a tested\ntheory. These new insights were made possible by close feedback between theory\nand experiment as well as advances in detector design and a novel machine\nconcept, namely that of an asymmetric collider. We also have direct {\\em\nexperimental} evidence that the observed CP violation in $K_L$ and B decays is\nmatched by a violation of microscopic time reversal violation, as required by\nCPT symmetry. More recently CP violation has been observed also in $B\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $B\\to K^{\\mp}\\pi^{\\pm}$. A few comments are added on subtle\naspects of direct CP violation.

In\nChapter 6, we proceed to consider field dynamics. A crucial feature of our\ndiscussion here is the degeneracy of the Lagrangian functionals for the field\ntheories of interest.

These equations are, generally speaking, nonlinear, and very hard to\nsolve. One way to address the problem is to obtain conservation laws of lower\norder than those of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. While in\nPhysics and Economics the question of existence of conservation laws is treated\nin a rather natural way, because the application itself suggest the\nconservation laws (e.g., conservation of energy, income/health law), from a\nstrictly mathematical point of view, given a problem of the calculus of\nvariations, it is not obvious how one might derive a conservation law or, for\nthat matter, if it even has a conservation law. The question we address is thus\nto develop computational facilities, based on a systematic method, which\npermits to identify functionals that have conservation laws. The central result\nwe use is the celebrated Noether's theorem. This theorem links conservation\nlaws with the invariance properties of the problem (with symmetries), and\nprovides an algorithm for finding conservation laws. Thus the problem is\nreduced to the one of finding the variational symmetries. We show how a\nComputer Algebra System can help to find the symmetries and the conservation\nlaws in the calculus of variations.
