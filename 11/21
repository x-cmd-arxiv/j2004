The coupling is\nmediated by the broad $5s5p \\phantom{}^1P_1$ state, exploiting the phenomenon\nof electromagnetically induced transparency. The effective linewidth of the\nclock transition can be chosen at will by adjusting the laser intensity. By\ntrapping the $^{88}$Sr atoms in an optical lattice, long interaction times with\nthe two lasers are ensured; Doppler and recoil effects are eliminated. Based on\na careful analysis of systematic errors, a clock accuracy of better than\n$2\\times 10^{-17}$ is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2004 00:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
