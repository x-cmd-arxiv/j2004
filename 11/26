At present, numerous surveys are aiming to determine the\nequation of state, which is assumed constant due to our poor understanding of\nits behaviour (and since higher order parameterisations lead to unwieldy\nerrors). This raises the question - how does our \"best-fit\" equation of state\nrelate to the true function, which may vary with redshift. Saini et al. have\ndemonstrated that the value of w attained by a supernovae study is well\ndescribed by a weighted integral over the true function. Adopting a similar\napproach, we calculate the corresponding \"weight function\" for a fiducial\ncosmic shear survey. We disentangle contributions from the angular diameter\ndistance and the growth factor, finding that they partially cancel each other\nout. Consequentially, the sensitivity to w at high redshift is enhanced beyond\nthat of supernovae studies, and is comparable, if not higher, than lensing of\nthe CMB. This illustrates the comlementary nature of the different techniques.\nFurthermore, we find that results which would naively be interpreted as\ninconsistent could arise from a time-dependent equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2004 19:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2005 10:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

This paper assumes the\npentagonal number theorem and uses it to prove a recurrence relation for the\nsum of divisors function. The term \"pentagonal numbers\" comes from polygonal\nnumbers. Euler takes the logarithmic derivative of both sides. Then after\nmultiplying both sides by $-x$, the left side is equal to $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\n\\sigma(n) x^n$, where $\\sigma(n)$ is the sum of the divisors of $n$, e.g.\n$\\sigma(6)=12$. This then leads to the recurrence relation for $\\sigma(n)$.\n  I have been studying in detail all of Euler's work on the pentagonal number\ntheorem, and more generally infinite products. I would be particularly\ninterested to see if anyone else worked with products and series like these\nbetween Euler and Jacobi, and I would enjoy hearing from anyone who knows\nsomething about this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2004 03:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 04:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2009 16:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-18"}

The fields for Hamilton's principle are shown to be\nthe Lagrangian coordinates of the fluid elements, which are potentials for the\nmatter current 4-vector and the electromagnetic field 2-form. The energy\nmomentum tensor and equations of motion are derived from the fields. In this\nway the theory of continua is shown to have the same form as other field\ntheories, such as electromagnetism and general relativity.\n  Waves are treated as an example of the power of field theoretic methods. The\naverage or background flow and the waves are considered as two interacting\ncomponents of the system. The wave-background interaction involves the transfer\nof energy and momentum between the waves and the average flow, but the total\nenergy and momentum are conserved. The average Lagrangian for the total\nwave-background system is found by expanding the Lagrangian about the\nbackground flow and averaging over the phase. The total energy-momentum tensor\nis constructed, and the conservation of energy and momentum are discussed.\nVarying the wave amplitude gives the dispersion and polarization relations for\nthe waves, and varying the phase gives the rays and conservation of wave quanta\n(or wave action). The wave quanta move with the group velocity along the\nbi-characteristic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2004 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This case is the 1D propagation in a homogeneous medium\nhaving two purely resistive terminations, the calculation of the Green function\nbeing done without any approximation using three methods. The first one is the\nstraightforward use of the closed-form solution in the frequency domain and the\nresidue calculus. Then the method of separation of variables (space and time)\nleads to a solution depending on the initial conditions. The question of the\northogonality and completeness of the complex-valued resonance modes is\ninvestigated, leading to the expression of a particular scalar product. The\nlast method is the expansion in biorthogonal modes in the frequency domain, the\nmodes having eigenfrequencies depending on the frequency. Results of the three\nmethods generalize or/and correct some results already existing in the\nliterature, and exhibit the particular difficulty of the treatment of the\nconstant mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2004 14:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2005 09:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2006 16:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we describe a computational\nsearch for ADAR editing sites in the human transcriptome, using millions of\navailable expressed sequences. 12,723 A-to-I editing sites were mapped in 1,637\ndifferent genes, with an estimated accuracy of 95%, raising the number of known\nediting sites by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally validated our\nmethod by verifying the occurrence of editing in 26 novel substrates. A-to-I\nediting in humans primarily occurs in non-coding regions of the RNA, typically\nin Alu repeats.

A generalization of the fundamental\nconstraints on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients which appear in the\nmaster equation for the damped quantum oscillator is presented; the\nSchr\\\"odinger, Heisenberg and Weyl-Wigner-Moyal representations of the Lindblad\nequation are given explicitly. On the basis of these representations it is\nshown that various master equations for the damped quantum oscillator used in\nthe literature are particular cases of the Lindblad equation and that not all\nof these equations are satisfying the constraints on quantum mechanical\ndiffusion coefficients. The master equation is transformed into Fokker-Planck\nequations for quasiprobability distributions and a comparative study is made\nfor the Glauber $P$ representation, the antinormal ordering $Q$ representation\nand the Wigner $W$ representation.
