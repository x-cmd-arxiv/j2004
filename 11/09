A blackbody component is likely to contribute to the observed\nspectrum, but it has bolometric luminosity L$_{\\rm bol} = 2.5 x 10^(33) x (d/1\nkpc)^2 erg s^(-1), therefore it is not sufficiently luminous to be due to a\ncentral white dwarf which is still burning hydrogen on the surface. An optical\nspectrum, taken 5 months post-outburst, indicates no intrinsic reddening of the\nejecta. Therefore, we conclude that the shell had already become optically thin\nto supersoft X-rays, but nuclear burning had already turned off, or was in the\nprocess of turning off at this time. We discuss why this implies that recurrent\nnovae, even the rare ones with long optical decays like IM Nor, indicating a\nlarge envelope mass, are not statistically significant as type Ia SN\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2004 20:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We find that pulses with hard spectra have the\nlargest lags, and that there is a similar, but weaker correlation between\nhardness-intensity correlation index, eta, and lag. We also find that the lags\ndiffer considerably between pulses within a burst. Furthermore, the peak energy\nmainly decreases with increasing lag. Assuming a lag-luminosity relation as\nsuggested by Norris et al., there will thus be a positive\nluminosity--peak-energy correlation. We also find that the hardness ratio, of\nthe total flux in two channels, only weakly correlates with the spectral\nevolution parameters. These results are consistent with those found in the\nanalytical and numerical analysis in Paper I. Finally, we find that for these\nbursts, dominated by a single pulse, there is a correlation between the\nobserved energy-flux, F, and the inverse of the lag, t_lag: F propto\nt_lag^{-1}. We interpret this flux-lag relation found as a consequence of the\nlag-luminosity relation and that these bursts have to be relatively narrowly\ndistributed in z.

We first consider the problem of a Gaussian chain\nfree to move in a random potential with short-ranged correlations. We derive\nthe equilibrium conformation of the chain using a replica variational ansatz,\nand highlight the crucial role of the system's volume. A mapping is established\nto that of a quantum particle in a random potential, and the phenomenon of\nlocalization is explained in terms of the dominance of localized tail states of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation. We also give a physical interpretation of the\n1-step replica-symmetry-breaking solution, and elucidate the connection with\nthe statistics of localized tail states. We proceeded to discuss the more\nrealistic case of a chain embedded in a sea of hard obstacles. Here, we show\nthat the chain size exhibits a rich scaling behavior, which depends critically\non the volume of the system. In particular, we show that a medium of hard\nobstacles can be approximated as a Gaussian random potential only for small\nsystem sizes. For larger sizes a completely different scaling behavior emerges.\nFinally we consider the case of a polymer with self-avoiding (excluded volume)\ninteractions. In this case it is found that when disorder is present, the\npolymer attains a conformation consisting of blobs connected by straight\nsegments. Using Flory type free energy arguments we analyze the statistics of\nthese conformational shapes, and show the existence of a\nlocalization-delocalization transition as a function of the strength of the\nself-avoiding interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2004 16:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we\nidentify the conditions and mechanisms for resonant tunneling through QW states\nin magnetic layers and determine candidate structures. We report\nfirst-principles calculations of spin-dependent transport in epitaxial\nFe/MgO/FeO/Fe/Cr and Co/MgO/Fe/Cr tunnel junctions. We demonstrate the\nformation of sharp QW states in the Fe layer and show discrete conductance\njumps as the QW states enter the transport window with increasing bias. At\nresonance, the current increases by one to two orders of magnitude. The\ntunneling magnetoresistance ratio is several times larger than in simple spin\ntunnel junctions and is positive (negative) for majority- (minority-) spin\nresonances, with a large asymmetry between positive and negative biases. The\nresults can serve as the basis for novel spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 15:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Polymers that exhibit large displacement in response to stimulation\nthat is other than electrical signal were known for many years.

In the present\npaper we develop a new approach to differential geometry of so-called rank 1\ncurves in Lagrange Grassmannian, i.e., the curves with velocities being rank\none linear mappings (under the standard identification of the tangent space to\na point of the Lagrange Grassmannian with an appropriate space of linear\nmappings). The curves of this class are associated with \"the Jacobi equations\nfor extremals\", corresponding to control systems with scalar control and to\nrank 2 vector distributions.

A regression tree\nis grown either on the treated or on the untreated individuals {\\it only} using\nas response variable a random permutation of the indexes 1...$n$ ($n$ being the\nnumber of units involved), while the indexes for the other group are predicted\nusing this tree. The procedure is replicated in order to rule out the effect of\nspecific permutations. The average treatment effect is estimated in each tree\nby matching treated and untreated in the same terminal nodes. The final\nestimator of the average treatment effect is obtained by averaging on all the\ntrees grown. The method does not require any specific model assumption apart\nfrom the tree's complexity, which does not affect the estimator though. We show\nthat this method is either an instrument to check whether two samples can be\nmatched (by any method) and, when this is feasible, to obtain reliable\nestimates of the average treatment effect. We further propose a graphical tool\nto inspect the quality of the match. The method has been applied to the\nNational Supported Work Demonstration data, previously analyzed by Lalonde\n(1986) and others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2004 14:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

We derive an explicit formula for the time evolution of the expectation\nof a general operator in the presence of stochastic reduction or\nenvironmentally induced decoherence, for both the non-dissipative harmonic\noscillator and the free mass.
