We perform a comprehensive\ncomparison of the model to the results of a suite of high-resolution\ncosmological simulations. The comparisons reveal that subhalo statistics, such\nas velocity and mass functions, radial distributions, and the halo occupation\ndistributions, agree well over three orders of magnitude in host halo mass at\nvarious redshifts. Both in the simulations and in our model, the radial\ndistributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the dark\nmatter density. The abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competition\nbetween destruction and new accretion. High mass halos and halos at high\nredshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, been\naccreted more recently. Similarly, at fixed mass, halos that formed more\nrecently host more subhalos. Observed \"fossil groups\" may represent an extreme\ntail of this correlation. We find a related correlation between host halo\nconcentration and subhalo abundance at fixed host mass, Nsat ~ c^-a, where a\nchanges with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. Lastly, we use our model\nto populate host halos in one of our high-resolution cosmological simulations,\nreplacing the subhalos resolved in the simulation with subhalos computed\naccording to our model. We show that the resulting 2pt correlation function of\nsuch a \"hybrid\" halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directly\nin the simulation.
