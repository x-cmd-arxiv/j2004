We compare the\nconstraints derived using SDSS bands only with those derived using the\ncombination of SDSS and GALEX photometry. We find that the addition of the\nGALEX bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dust\noptical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 Myr to 1 Gyr\nin a galaxy. We are sensitive to SFRs as low as 10^{-3} M_sun/yr, and we find\nthat low levels of star formation (SF) are mostly associated with early-type,\nred galaxies. The least massive galaxies have ratios of current to\npast-averaged SF rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant SF over a Hubble\ntime. For late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. We\nfind that b correlates tightly with NUV-r color, implying that the SF history\nof a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the NUV-r color alone. The\nfraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode within\nthe last 1 Gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8\nM_sun to ~5% for ~10^11 M_sun galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2004 22:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Our approach is motivated by the hypothesis that in simple\norganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for\npredicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in a particular experiment\nbased on (1) the presence of binding site subsequences (``motifs'') in the\ngene's regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of regulators such as\ntranscription factors in the experiment (``parents''). Thus our learning task\nintegrates two qualitatively different data sources: genome-wide cDNA\nmicroarray data across multiple perturbation and mutant experiments along with\nmotif profile data from regulatory sequences. We convert the regression task of\npredicting real-valued gene expression measurement to a classification task of\npredicting +1 and -1 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond\nthe levels of biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. The\nlearning algorithm employed is boosting with a margin-based generalization of\ndecision trees, alternating decision trees. This large-margin classifier is\nsufficiently flexible to allow complex logical functions, yet sufficiently\nsimple to give insight into the combinatorial mechanisms of gene regulation. We\nobserve encouraging prediction accuracy on experiments based on the Gasch S.\ncerevisiae dataset, and we show that we can accurately predict up- and\ndown-regulation on held-out experiments.
