We measure structural properties of the galaxies from the HST\nimaging, and find that the color division corresponds generally to a structural\ndivision. Most red galaxies, ~ 75%, are centrally concentrated, with a red\nbulge or spheroid, while blue galaxies usually have exponential profiles.\nHowever, there are two subclasses of red galaxies that are not bulge-dominated:\nedge-on disks and a second category which we term diffuse red galaxies\n(DIFRGs). The distant edge-on disks are similar in appearance and frequency to\nthose at low redshift, but analogs of DIFRGs are rare among local red galaxies.\nDIFRGs have significant emission lines, indicating that they are reddened\nmainly by dust rather than age. The DIFRGs in our sample are all at z>0.64,\nsuggesting that DIFRGs are more prevalent at high redshifts; they may be\nrelated to the dusty or irregular extremely red objects (EROs) beyond z>1.2\nthat have been found in deep K-selected surveys.

We show that if the waves are\noriginated on a 5-d space-time which fulfills the principle of general\nrelativity, then the process of compactification can not reduce the dynamics to\nthe pure 4-dimensional scalar, vector and tensor degrees of freedom. In\nparticular, while the electromagnetic waves evolve independently, the scalar\nand tensor fields couple to each other; this feature appears because, when the\ngauge conditions are splitted, the presence of the scalar ripple prevents that\nthe 4-d gravitational waves are traceless. The phenomenological issue of this\nscheme consists of an anomalous relative amplitude of the two independent\npolarizations which characterize the 4-d gravitational waves. Such profile of\npolarization amplitudes, if detected, would outline the extra-dimension in a\nvery reliable way, because a wave with non-zero trace can not arise from\nordinary matter sources. We discuss the above mentioned phenomenon either in\nthe case of a unit constant value of the background scalar component (when the\ngeodesic deviation is treated with precise outputs), and assuming such\nbackground field as a dynamical degree (only qualitative conclusion are\nprovided here, because the details of the polarization amplitudes depend on the\nchoice of specific metric forms).

Thus the accomplishment of\nthis task is central to physics and cosmology. Current fashionable\nsupersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate, which is the\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Since the LSP is much heavier than the\nproton, while its average energy is in the keV region, the most likely\npossibility for its direct detection is via its elastic scattering with a\nnuclear target.

The replacement of the old gas detector was required due to an\nexpected increase in instantaneous luminosity of the Tevatron collider in the\nnext few years. Calorimeter coverage, jet energy resolution, and electron and\nphoton identification are among the expected improvements. The final detector\ndesign, together with the R$&$D studies that led to the choice of scintillator\nand fiber, mechanical assembly, and quality control are presented. The detector\nwas installed in the fall 2004 Tevatron shutdown and started collecting\ncolliding beam data by the end of the same year. First measurements indicate a\nlight yield of 12 photoelectrons/MIP, a more than two-fold increase over the\ndesign goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2004 14:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2005 19:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2005 21:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
