These inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos,\nwhich are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which are\nnot. The minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trap\nintergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them of\nionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. The\nlower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them down\nby increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. In\nthis paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, including\nnonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both IGM clumping and collapsed\nminihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization.\nWhile the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time,\nthe density of minihalos inside H II regions around ionizing sources is largely\nconstant. Thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number of\nionizing photons available to the IGM at all epochs, which is equivalent to a\nreduction in the luminosity of each source. On the other hand, the effect of\nIGM clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization and\nextending it. Thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with the\nunknown source efficiency, IGM clumping can help significantly in reconciling\nthe recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasar\nabsorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extended\nreionization epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2004 21:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2005 21:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

QKD systems and similar protocols use classical\nerror-correcting codes for both error correction (for the honest parties to\ncorrect errors) and privacy amplification (to make an eavesdropper fully\nignorant). From a coding perspective, a good model that corresponds to such a\nsetting is the wire tap channel introduced by Wyner in 1975. In this paper, we\nstudy fundamental limits and coding methods for wire tap channels. We provide\nan alternative view of the proof for secrecy capacity of wire tap channels and\nshow how capacity achieving codes can be used to achieve the secrecy capacity\nfor any wiretap channel. We also consider binary erasure channel and binary\nsymmetric channel special cases for the wiretap channel and propose specific\npractical codes. In some cases our designs achieve the secrecy capacity and in\nothers the codes provide security at rates below secrecy capacity. For the\nspecial case of a noiseless main channel and binary erasure channel, we\nconsider encoder and decoder design for codes achieving secrecy on the wiretap\nchannel; we show that it is possible to construct linear-time decodable secrecy\ncodes based on LDPC codes that achieve secrecy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2004 10:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2005 12:18:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2007 08:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Using\ntime-resolved dc conductivity, the effect of 1064 nm laser photoexcitation of\ntrapped electrons on the charge transport has been observed in liquid n-hexane\nand methylcyclohexane. The light promotes the electron from the trap into the\nconduction band of the liquid, instantaneously increasing the conductivity by\norders of magnitude. From the analysis of the two-pulse, two-color\nphotoconductivity data, the residence time of the electrons in traps has been\nestimated as ca. 8.4 ps for n-hexane and ca. 13 ps for methylcyclohexane (at\n295 K). The rate of detrapping decreases at lower temperature with an\nactivation energy of ca. 200 meV (280-320 K); the lifetime-mobility product for\nquasifree electrons scales linearly with the temperature. We suggest that the\nproperties of trapped electrons in hydrocarbon liquids can be well accounted\nfor using the simple electron bubble (Wigner-Seiz spherical well) model. The\nestimated localization time of the quasifree electron is 20-50 fs; both time\nestimates are in good agreement with the \"quasiballistic\" model. This\nlocalization time is significantly lower than the value of ca. 300 fs obtained\nusing time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy for the same system [E. Knoesel\net al., J. Chem.

We suggest that the THz signal\noriginates from the oscillations of electron bubbles rather than the\nfree-electron plasma; vibrations of these bubbles may be responsible for the\ndeviations from the Drude behavior observed below 0.4 THz.
