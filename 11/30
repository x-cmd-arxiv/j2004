It appears that the L/T transition takes place at around Teff =\n1400K, where Tcr shows a particularly large change. Thus the L/T transition is\nassociated with a drastic change of the thickness of the dust cloud at around\nTeff = 1400K, but the reason for this change is unknown. Once we allow Tcr to\nvary at given Teff and log g, the two-color and color-magnitude diagrams can be\nwell explained as the effect of Teff, log g, and Tcr, but not by that of Teff\nand log g alone. In general, the effects of Teff and Tcr are difficult to\ndiscriminate on individual spectra, but this degeneracy of Teff and Tcr can be\nremoved to some extent by the analysis of the SED on an absolute scale. The\nreanalysis of a selected sample of spectra revealed that the L-T spectral\nsequence may not necessarily be a sequence of Teff, but may reflect a change of\nthe thickness of the dust cloud, represented by Tcr in our UCM. Also, an odd\n'brightening' of the absolute J magnitudes plotted against the L-T spectral\ntypes may also be a manifestation that the L-T spectral sequence is not a\ntemperature sequence, since Mbol also shows a similar 'brightening'. Then, the\n'J-brightening' may not be due to any atmospheric effect and hence should not\nbe a problem to be solved by model atmospheres including the UCMs. Thus, almost\nall the available observed data are reasonably well interpreted with the UCMs\nin which the cloud thickness varies, and the problem now is how to understand\nwhy the cloud thickness (or Tcr) changes independently of Teff and log g.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2004 16:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2004 07:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2005 03:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We\ncompare accretion disk model atmospheres with the observed spectrum in order to\nconstrain the stratification of density and ionization, disk atmosphere area,\nelemental composition, and energetics. The atmospheric spectrum observed during\nthe low state is photoionized by the main-on X-ray continuum, indicating that\nthe disk is observed edge-on during the low state. We infer the mean number of\nscatterings N of Ly-alpha and Ly-beta line photons from H-like ions. We derive\nN < 69 for O VIII Ly_alpha_1, which rules out the presence of a mechanism\nmodeled by Sako (2003) to enhance N VII emission via a line overlap with O\nVIII. The line optical depth diagnostics are consistent with a flattened\natmosphere. Our spectral analysis, the disk atmosphere model, and the presence\nof intense N VII and N VI lines (plus N V in the UV), confirm the\nover-abundance of nitrogen relative to other metals, which was shown to be\nindicative of CNO cycle processing in a massive progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2004 00:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We constrain the physical disk\nmodel by stipulating that the stress must vanish at the horizon, which is the\nfundamental inner boundary condition imposed by general relativity.\nSurprisingly, we find that none of the three alternative viscosity\nprescriptions yield physically acceptable disk structures close to the horizon\nwhen the zero-torque condition is applied, whether the flow is in vertical\nhydrostatic equilibrium or free-fall. Hence we conclude that the original\nShakura-Sunyaev prescription is the only one proposed so far that is physically\nconsistent close to the event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 2004 15:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the opposite case it should be averaged over\nall microstates that gives rise to the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy (BSE).\nMaximum entropy principle (MEP) for the BSE leads to the Gibbs canonical\ndistribution that is incompatible with power--low distributions typical for\ncomplex system. This brings up the question: Does the maximum of BSE correspond\nto an equilibrium (or steady) state of the complex system? Indeed, the\nequilibrium state of a thermodynamic system which exchange heat with a\nthermostat corresponds to maximum of Helmholtz free energy rather than to\nmaximum of average energy, that is internal energy $U$. Following derivation of\nHelmholtz free energy the Renyi entropy is derived as a cumulant average of the\nBoltzmann entropy for systems which exchange an entropy with the thermostat.\nThe application of MEP to the Renyi entropy gives rise to the Renyi\ndistribution for an isolated system. It is investigated for a particular case\nof a power--law Hamiltonian. Both Lagrange parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can\nbe eliminated.

We discuss in this\nreview a particularly important spin decoherence channel, and bandstructure\neffects on the exchange gate control.

We find that the present B -> pi pi and B -> pi K data\ncannot be simultaneously described in the Standard Model. In a simple extension\nin which new physics enters dominantly through Z^0 penguins with a CP-violating\nphase, only certain B -> pi K modes are affected by new physics. The B -> pi pi\ndata can then be described entirely within the Standard Model but with values\nof hadronic parameters that reflect large non-factorizable contributions. Using\nthe SU(3) flavour symmetry and plausible dynamical assumptions, we can then use\nthe B -> pi pi decays to fix the hadronic part of the B -> pi K system and make\npredictions for various observables in the B_d -> pi^-+ K^+- and B^+- -> pi^+-\nK decays that are practically unaffected by electroweak penguins. The data on\nthe B^+- -> pi^0 K^+- and B_d -> pi^0 K modes allow us then to determine the\nelectroweak penguin component which differs from the Standard Model one, in\nparticular through a large additional CP-violating phase. The implications for\nrare K and B decays are spectacular. In particular, the rate for K_L -> pi^0 nu\n\\bar nu is enhanced by one order of magnitude, the branching ratios for B_{d,s}\n-> mu^+ mu^- by a factor of five, and BR(K_L -> pi^0 e^+ e^-, pi^0 mu^+ mu^-)\nby factors of three.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2004 17:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The essential point is to resolve problems in parametrized homotopy\ntheory that have no nonparametrized counterparts.

The basic path integral solutions, which appear here in a\ncomplicated way, have been developed in recent work and are known. The final\nsolutions are represented in terms of the corresponding Green's functions and\nthe expansions into the wave-functions, respectively. We also sketch some\nlimiting cases of the Darboux spaces, where spaces of constant negative and\nzero curvature emerge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2004 18:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2005 15:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
