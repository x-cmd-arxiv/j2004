In gas-rich mergers of galaxies,\nwe observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central AGN activity when\nthe tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an\naccreting supermassive black hole has grown to a critical size, feedback\nterminates its further growth, and expels gas from the central region in a\npowerful quasar-driven wind.

Just based on the\nexistence of the absolute background for space, an explicit dynamical equation\nwhich satisfies a moderately general principle of relativity is logically\nderived under the nonrelativistic framework of classical mechanics. The nature\nof the inertial force is firstly revealed as the real forces acting on the\nreference object. Therefore, Einstein's equivalence principle should be\nabandoned and only the numerical equality between the inertial mass and\ngravitational mass can be retained. Consequently, the candidate for the\nstandard clock should be changed and an adjusted physical picture for how to\nconvert the gravitational force into a geometric effect on space-time is\nthereby presented. As for cosmology, it should be emphasized that the observer\nat the present time on the earth, instead of the comoving observer, is the only\ntrue observer. The coordinate time \"t\" in the cosmological metric is just\nintroduced as the reading number of the observational clock, whose running rate\nis duplicated from the clock equipped by the observer at the present time on\nthe earth. With this new physical picture of space-time, an extra factor $b(t)$\nmust be introduced into the cosmological metric to describe the gravitational\ntime dilation effect since the comoving local intrinsic clock will run in a\nfaster and faster rate with the expanding of the universe. In this way, we may\nobtain a positive value of $\\rho+3p$ and avoid the introduction of dark energy\nin the current universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2004 01:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 17:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 13:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2004 03:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 08:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 13:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2011 09:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 15:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 00:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 05:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 14:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

As an early pattern formation step in\nDrosophila embryos, an anterior-posterior gradient of Bicoid (Bcd) induces\nhunchback (hb) expression (Driever et al. 1989; Tautz et al. 1988). In contrast\nto the Bcd gradient, the Hb profile includes information about the scale of the\nembryo. Furthermore, the resulting hb expression pattern shows a much lower\nembryo-to-embryo variability than the Bcd gradient (Houchmandzadeh et al.\n2002). An additional graded posterior repressing activity could theoretically\naccount for the observed scaling. However, we show that such a model cannot\nproduce the observed precision in the Hb boundary, such that a fundamentally\ndifferent mechanism must be at work. We describe and simulate a model that can\naccount for the observed precise generation of the scaled Hb profile in a\nhighly robust manner. The proposed mechanism includes Staufen (Stau), an RNA\nbinding protein that appears essential to precision scaling (Houchmandzadeh et\nal. 2002). In the model, Stau is released from both ends of the embryo and\nrelocalises hb RNA by increasing its mobility. This leads to an effective\ntransport of hb away from the respective Stau sources. The balance between\nthese opposing effects then gives rise to scaling and precision. Considering\nthe biological importance of robust precision scaling and the simplicity of the\nmodel, the same principle may be employed more often during development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2004 12:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
