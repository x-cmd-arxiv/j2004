We\nsuggest that the increase in FUV diffuse fraction at large galactocentric radii\ncould indicate that a substantial portion of the diffuse emission beyond this\npoint is not generated in situ but rather scattered from dust, after\noriginating in the vicinity of the disk's outermost HII regions.

We\nshow that we are not limited by systematic errors and use our results to place\njoint constraints on the matter density parameter Omega_m and the amplitude of\nthe matter power spectrum sigma_8. We find sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.65}=0.68 +/-\n0.13 where the 1sigma error includes both our uncertainty on the median\nredshift of the survey and sampling variance.\n  Removing image and point spread function (PSF) distortions are crucial to all\nweak lensing analyses. We therefore include a thorough discussion on the degree\nof ACS PSF distortion and anisotropy which we characterise directly from GEMS\ndata. Consecutively imaged over 20 days, GEMS data also allows us to\ninvestigate PSF instability over time. We find that, even in the relatively\nshort GEMS observing period, the ACS PSF ellipticity varies at the level of a\nfew percent which we account for with a semi-time dependent PSF model. Our\ncorrection for the temporal and spatial variability of the PSF is shown to be\nsuccessful through a series of diagnostic tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2004 07:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2005 15:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We show that\nthe river model works also for rotating (Kerr-Newman) black holes, though with\na surprising twist. As in the spherical case, the river of space can be\nregarded as moving through a flat background. However, the river does not\nspiral inward, as one might have anticipated, but rather falls inward with no\nazimuthal swirl at all. Instead, the river has at each point not only a\nvelocity but also a rotation, or twist. That is, the river has a Lorentz\nstructure, characterized by six numbers (velocity and rotation), not just three\n(velocity). As an object moves through the river, it changes its velocity and\nrotation in response to tidal changes in the velocity and twist of the river\nalong its path. An explicit expression is given for the river field, a\nsix-component bivector field that encodes the velocity and twist of the river\nat each point, and that encapsulates all the properties of a stationary\nrotating black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2004 03:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 19:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

If the conductivity is at the continuum threshold\nkappa_oo, then the solution cycles repeatedly between ingoing and outgoing,\ndisplaying a discrete self-similarity reminiscent of that observed in critical\ncollapse. Below the continuum threshold kappa_oo, and except at the discrete\nvalues kappa_n, the baryonic fluid drops through the Cauchy horizon, and in\nthis case undergoes a shock, downstream of which the solution terminates at an\nirregular sonic point where the proper acceleration diverges, and there is no\nconsistent self-similar continuation to zero radius.

If the\nradial direction remains timelike to zero radius (which cannot be confirmed\nbecause the self-similar solutions terminate), then there is presumably a\nspacelike singularity at zero radius inside the Cauchy horizon, which is\ndistinctly different from the vacuum solution for a charged black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2004 04:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2005 15:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}
