The remote field IMF studied in the LMC by several authors is clearly\nsteeper than most cluster IMFs, which have slopes close to the Salpeter value.\nLocal field regions of star formation, like Taurus, may have relatively steep\nIMFs too. Very dense and massive clusters, like super star clusters, could have\nflatter IMFs, or inner-truncated IMFs. We propose that these variations are the\nresult of three distinct processes during star formation that affect the mass\nfunction in different ways depending on mass range. At solar to intermediate\nstellar masses, gas processes involving thermal pressure and supersonic\nturbulence determine the basic scale for stellar mass, starting with the\nobserved pre-stellar condensations, and they define the mass function from\nseveral tenths to several solar masses. Brown dwarfs require extraordinarily\nhigh pressures for fragmentation from the gas, and presumably form inside the\npre-stellar condensations during mutual collisions, secondary fragmentations,\nor in disks. High mass stars form in excess of the numbers expected from pure\nturbulent fragmentation as pre-stellar condensations coalesce and accrete with\nan enhanced gravitational cross section. Variations in the interaction rate,\ninteraction strength, and accretion rate among the primary fragments formed by\nturbulence lead to variations in the relative proportions of brown dwarfs,\nsolar to intermediate mass stars, and high mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2004 15:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is\ncurrently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not\nexamined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a\nnetwork-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that\nend. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter)\nare quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a\nconcern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic\nthat they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of\nredundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are\nimportant. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two\nkinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in\nconflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an\nalgorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and\nend systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to\nand from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe\neach path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can\nreduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while\npermitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links. We then show\nhow to enable efficient communication between monitors through the use of Bloom\nfilters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2004 21:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A model for the H-mode pedestal and for the triggering of ELMs\npredicts the height, width, and shape of the H-mode pedestal and the frequency\nand width of ELMs. Formation of the pedestal and the L-H transition is the\ndirect result of ExB flow shear suppression of anomalous transport. The\nperiodic ELM crashes are triggered by either the ballooning or peeling MHD\ninstabilities. The BALOO, DCON, and ELITE ideal MHD stability codes are used to\nderive a new parametric expression for the peeling-ballooning threshold. The\nnew dependence for the peeling-ballooning threshold is implemented in the ASTRA\ntransport code. Results of integrated modeling of DIII-D like discharges are\npresented and compared with experimental observations. The results from the\nideal MHD stability codes are compared with results from the resistive MHD\nstability code NIMROD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2004 15:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We answer this question in\nthe negative, exhibiting a communication problem where classical communication\nwith public coin is exponentially more efficient than quantum communication.\nTogether with a separation in the other direction due to Bar-Yossef et al.,\nthis shows that the quantum SMP model is incomparable with the classical\npublic-coin SMP model.\n  In addition we give a characterization of the power of quantum fingerprinting\nby means of a connection to geometrical tools from machine learning, a\nquadratic improvement of Yao's simulation, and a nearly tight analysis of the\nHamming distance problem from Yao's paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2004 11:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}
