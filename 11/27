Current measurement of the orbital inclination allows the\nmillisecond pulsar (A) to pass very close (at R_{min}=4000 km) in projection to\nthe companion pulsar (B), with R_{min} comparable to the Einstein radius (2600\nkm). For this separation at the conjunction, lensing causes small (about 10%)\nmagnification of the pulsar A signal on a timescale of several seconds, and\ndisplaces the pulsar image on the sky plane by about 1200 km. More importantly,\nlensing introduces a correction (of several microsec) to the conventional\nShapiro delay formula used in pulsar timing analysis, and gives rise to a\ngeometric time delay together with the delays associated with the pulsar spin\nperiod. These lensing effects can influence the determination of the system\nparameters by both timing and scintillation studies. Given the current\nuncertainty in the orbital inclination, more extreme manifestations of lensing\n(e.g. magnification by a factor of several) are possible. We compare our\npredictions with the existing observations and discuss the possibility of\ndetecting gravitational lensing signatures in the system.

From the observed radio to X-ray spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) templates, we propose to subtract the typical energy\ndistributions of, respectively, the elliptical galaxy host and the synchrotron\nradiation. The resulting SED reveals that the main dust emission is well fitted\nby the sum of two blackbody components at the respective temperatures 340K+-50K\nand 40K+-16K. When the AGN is active, the energy rate released by hot dust is\nmuch more dissipative than cold dust and stellar emission, even when the\nelliptical galaxy emission is maximum at age of ~ 90 Myr.

We use the polarization state of biphotons,propagating in single\nfrequency- and spatial mode, to generate an arbitrary qutrits. In particular\nthe specific sequence of states that are used in the extended version of BB84\nquantum key distribution protocol was generated and tested. We experimentally\nverify the orthogonality of the 12 basic states and demonstrate the ability of\nswitching between them. The tomography procedure is applied to reconstruct the\ndensity matrices of generated states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Nov 2004 09:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
