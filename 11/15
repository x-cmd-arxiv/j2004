We\ninvestigate in some details the cosmic ray, neutrinos and high-energy photons\nyield in hotspots of powerful FRII radio-galaxies by scanning all known spatial\ntransport regimes, adiabatic and radiative losses as well as Fermi acceleration\nprocess. Since both electrons and cosmic rays are prone to the same type of\nacceleration, we derive analytical estimates of the maximal cosmic ray energy\nattainable in both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field dominated shock\nstructures by using observational data on synchrotron emission coming from\nvarious hot-spots. One of our main conclusions is that the best hot-spot\ncandidates for high energy astroparticle production is the extended\n($L_{HS}\\geq 1kpc$), strongly magnetized ($B> 0.1mG$) terminal shock displaying\nsynchrotron emission cut-off lying at least in the optical band. We found only\none object (3C273A) over the six objects in our sample being capable to produce\ncosmic rays up to $10^{20}$ eV. Secondly, we investigate the astroparticle\nspectra produced by two characteric hot-spots (Cygnus A and 3C273 A) by\napplying a multi-scale MHD-kinetic scheme, coupling MHD simulations to kinetic\ncomputations using stochastic differential equations. We show that 3C273 A,\nmatching the previous properties, may produce protons up to $10^{20}$ eV in a\nKolmogorov type turbulence by both computing electron and cosmic ray\nacceleration. We also calculate the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes\non Earth produced through p-$\\gamma$ and p-p processes and compare them to the\nmost sensitive astroparticle experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2004 12:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Sawtooth and Mirnov oscillations caused by MHD\ninstabilities are generally observed in Tokamak discharges. Observation of\nthese effects in the visible radiation from outer edge may offer a possible\nmeans to understand the transport.Oscillations in the visible radiation from\nouter region of the plasma have been observed during recent Aditya discharges.\nPercentage modulation of these oscillations vary with the Lines of Sight (LOS)\nof the chords and surfaces on which they terminate. This has been found in both\nthe low frequency (~1 kHz) oscillations that seem to correlate with sawteething\nin SXR signals and the higher frequency (~10 kHz) oscillations that correlate\nwell with Mirnov signals indicative of m/n=2/1 mode rotation. This suggests\nthat the extent to which the MHD instabilities in the central region of the\nplasma column are reflected in the edge radiation depends on the interaction of\nthe plasma with the surface at the extremity of the LOS. The release of\nparticle/ energy accompanying the MHD instabilities leads to a large influx of\nparticles from such surfaces. Cross-bispectral analysis suggests that a mode\n(having frequency of ~20 kHz) is also generated due to the interaction of\nm/n=1/1 (~10 kHz, seen in SXR) and m/n=2/1 (~10 kHz, seen in Mirnov, Visible &\nMicrowave Interferometer signals). By possible selection rules, this mode seems\nto be a m/n=3/2 mode. This mode is seen in Mirnov, Visible & Interferometer\nsignals.

We show that it is desirable for the electrode structure to produce a\nd.c. octupole moment with an a.c. radial quadrupole. For the case where\nelectrical breakdown limits the voltages that can be applied, we show that the\noctupole is more demanding than the quadrupole when the characteristic distance\nscale of the structure is larger than 1 to 10 microns (for typical materials).\nWe present a variety of approaches and optimizations of structures consisting\nof one to three layers of electrodes. The three-layer structures allow the\nfastest operation at given distance r from the trap centres to the nearest\nelectrode surface, but when the total thickness w of the structure is\nconstrained, leading to w < r, then two-layer structures may be preferable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2004 12:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2005 13:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We demonstrate\nhow to simulate Ising Hamiltonians in a many ions setup, and how to create\nhighly entangled states and induce squeezing. Finally, in a detailed analysis\nwe identify the physical limits of this technique and study the dependence of\nerrors on the temperature. [1] J.I. Cirac, P. Zoller, Nature, 404, 579, 2000.\n[2] J.J.
