No OVI absorption was detected with significance\ngreater than 2 sigma for 12 of the 25 stars, where the 1 sigma uncertainty is 4\nmA, equivalent to an OVI column density of ~3 x 10^12 cm^-2. Of the remaining\nstars, most have column densities N(OVI) < 10^13 cm^-2 and no column densities\nexceed 1.7 x 10^13 cm^-2. For lines of sight to hot (T_eff > 40,000 K) white\ndwarfs, there is some evidence that the OVI absorption may be at least\npartially photospheric or circumstellar in origin. We interpret the \"patchy\"\ndistribution of OVI absorption in terms of a model where OVI is formed in\nevaporative interfaces between cool clouds and the hot, diffuse gas in the\nLocal Bubble (LB). If the clouds contain tangled or tangential magnetic fields,\nthen thermal conduction will be quenched over most of the cloud surface, and\nOVI will be formed only in local \"patches\" where conduction is allowed to\noperate.

The initial conditions of the two calculations are identical\nexcept for the radii of the clouds, which are chosen so that the mean densities\nand mean thermal Jeans masses of the clouds differ by factors of nine and\nthree, respectively. We find that the denser cloud, with the lower mean thermal\nJeans mass, produces a higher proportion of brown dwarfs and has a lower\ncharacteristic (median) mass of the stars and brown dwarfs. This dependence of\nthe initial mass function (IMF) on the density of the cloud may explain the\nobservation that the Taurus star-forming region appears to be deficient in\nbrown dwarfs when compared with the Orion Trapezium cluster. The new\ncalculation also produces wide binaries (separations >20 AU), one of which is a\nwide binary brown dwarf system. Based on the hydrodynamical calculations, we\ndevelop a simple accretion/ejection model for the origin of the IMF. In the\nmodel, all stars and brown dwarfs begin with the same mass (set by the opacity\nlimit for fragmentation) and grow in mass until their accretion is terminated\nstochastically by their ejection from the cloud through dynamically\ninteractions. The model predicts that the main variation of the IMF in\ndifferent star-forming environments should be in the location of the peak (due\nto variations in the mean thermal Jeans mass of the cloud) and in the\nsubstellar regime.

The anisotropies of the GWBs\nthus play a crucial role to discriminate various components of the GWBs. We\nstudy general features of antenna pattern sensitivity to the anisotropies of\nGWBs beyond the low-frequency approximation. We show that the sensitivity of\nspace-based interferometer to GWBs is severely restricted by the data\ncombinations and the symmetries of the detector configuration.

Though not\nunified into a simple group, these theories preserve the successful\nsupersymmetric relation of gauge couplings, as they start out with equal SU(3)\nand SU(2) couplings and the correct initial sin^2\\theta_W at the\ncompactification scale of M_{GUT}\\simeq 2x10^{16} GeV, and they have the\nminimal low-energy particle content of split supersymmetry. We also propose a\nmechanism in which the gauginos and higgsinos are further protected by a\ndiscrete R-symmetry against gravitational corrections, as the gravitino gets an\ninvariant Dirac mass by pairing with a member of a Kaluza-Klein tower of\nspin-3/2 particles. In addition to the models proposed here, split\nsupersymmetry offers novel strategies for realistic model-building. So,\nTeV-scale string models previously dismissed because of rapid proton decay, or\nincorrect sin^2\\theta_W, or because there were no unused dimensions into which\nto dilute the strength of gravity, can now be reconsidered as candidates for\nrealistic split theories with string scale near M_{GUT}, as long as the\ngauginos and higgsinos remain light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2004 17:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}

The significant enhancement of he fusion cross\nsetion at sub-barrier energies was understood in terms of the dynamical\nprocesses arising from strong couplings to collective inelastic excitations of\nthe target and projectile. However, in the case of reactions where breakup\nbecomes an important process, conflicing model predictions and experimental\nresults have been reported in the literature. Excitation functions for sub- and\nnear-barrier total (complete + incomplete) fusion cross sections have been\nmeasured for the $^{6,7}$Li + $^{59}$Co at the Vivitron facility and at the 8UD\nPelletron tandem facility using standard $\\gamma$-ray techniques.

The latter\ntype of response gives rise to a bimodal distribution in protein levels in an\nensemble of cells. One possible origin of binary response is cellular\nbistability achieved through positive feedback or autoregulation. In this\npaper, we study a simple, stochastic model of GE and show that the origin of\nbinary response lies exclusively in stochasticity. The transitions between the\nactive and inactive states of the gene are random in nature. Graded and binary\nresponses occur in the model depending on the relative stability of the\nactivated and deactivated gene states with respect to that of\nmRNAs/proteins.The theoretical results on binary response provide a good\ndescription of the ``all-or-none'' phenomenon observed in an eukaryotic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2004 10:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The analysis of the DNA array\ndata is typically qualitative aiming to establish the presence or absence of a\nparticular point mutation. Our theoretical approach yields methods for\nquantifying the analysis so as to obtain the ratio of concentrations of mutated\nand wild type DNA. Method: The theory is formulated in terms of the\nhybridization isotherms relating the hybridization fraction at the spot to the\ncomposition of the sample solutions at thermodynamic equilibrium. It focuses on\nsamples containing an excess of single stranded DNA and on DNA arrays with low\nsurface density of probes. The hybridization equilibrium constants can be\nobtained by the nearest neighbor method. Results: Two approaches allow us to\nobtain quantitative results from the DNA array data. In one the signal of the\nmutation spot is compared with that of the wild type spot. The implementation\nrequires knowledge of the saturation intensity of the two spots. The second\napproach requires comparison of the intensity of the mutation spot at two\ndifferent temperatures. In this case knowledge of the saturation signal is not\nalways necessary.

One is to reduce the\nproblem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in\nterms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem\ncombines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then\nbecomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.\nIndeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated\ninto another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators\nprovide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,\nincluding entanglement, decoherence, and Feynman's rest of the universe. In\naddition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a\nphysics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the\nLorentz group which can be represented by the group of by two-by-two matrices\ncommonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can therefore\nplay the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. Both Paul\nA. M. Dirac and Richard P.

Both were also keenly\ninterested in making quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity.
