No deceleration or expansion parameters are needed. The\nplasma-redshift cosmology is flat and quasi-static on a large scale. The Hubble\nconstant is no longer an expansion parameter, but is instead a measure of the\naverage electron density along the line of sight towards an object. Perusal of\nthe SNe Ia data and quasar data has shown that there is no time dilation. The\nconventional estimates of the Hubble constant from gravitational lensing\nobservations use the big-bang cosmology for interpreting the observations.

The\npurpose of the present article is to show that the gravitational lensing\nobservations are in agreement with the plasma-redshift cosmology, and to show\nhow to evaluate the lensing observations based on the new plasma-redshift\ncosmology.

Near maser maximum (Epochs III and IV), the individual components of\nboth masers are distributed in ring-like structures but the ring is severely\ndisrupted near stellar maser minimum (Epochs I and II). In Epochs III and IV\nthere is a large overlap between the radii at which the two maser transitions\noccur. However in both epochs the average radius of the v=2 maser ring is\nsmaller than for the v=1 maser ring, the difference being larger for Epoch IV.\nThe observed relative ring radii in the two transitions, and the trends on the\nring thickness, are close to those predicted by the model of Humphreys et al.\n(\\cite{humphreys02}). In many individual features there is an almost exact\noverlap in space and velocity of emission from the two transitions, arguing\nagainst pure radiative pumping. At both Epochs III and IV in many spectral\nfeatures only 50% of the flux density is recovered in our images, implying\nsignificant smooth maser structure. For both transitions we find that red- and\nblue-shifted masers occur in all parts of the rings, with relatively few masers\nat the systemic velocity. Thus there is no evidence for rotation, although the\nblue-shifted masers are somewhat more prominent to the west. At all four epochs\nred-shifted components are generally brighter than blue-shifted ones. At Epochs\nIII and IV, we see many filamentary or spoke-like features in both v=1 and v=2\nmasers, especially in the red-shifted gas.

The self-consistency of the\nstellar spiral pattern was studied in previous work (see Martos et al. 2004).\nIt is a sensitive function of the pattern rotation speed, $\\Omega_p$, among\nother parameters which include the mass in the spiral and its pitch angle. Here\nwe further discuss the complex gaseous response found there for plausible\nvalues of $\\Omega_p$ in our Galaxy, and argue that its value must be close to\n$20 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}$ from the strong self-consistency criterion and other\nrecent, independent studies which depend on such parameter. However, other\nvalues of $\\Omega_p$ that have been used in the literature are explored to\nstudy the gas response to the stellar (K band) 2-armed pattern. For our best\nfit values, the gaseous response to the 2-armed pattern displayed in the K band\nis a four-armed pattern with complex features in the interarm regions. This\nresponse resembles the optical arms observed in the Milky Way and other\ngalaxies with the smooth underlying two-armed pattern of the old stellar disk\npopulations in our interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2004 04:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The central results consist in (a)\njustifying the use of relative entropy as the uniquely natural criterion to\nselect a \"best\" approximation from within a family of trial distributions, and\n(b) to quantify the extent to which non-optimal trial distributions are ruled\nout. The Bogoliuvob variational method is shown to be included as a special\ncase. As an illustration we apply our method to simple fluids. In a first use\nof the ME method the \"exact\" canonical distribution is approximated by that of\na fluid of hard spheres and ME is used to select the optimal value of the\nhard-sphere diameter. A second, more refined application of the ME method\napproximates the \"exact\" distribution by a suitably weighed average over\ndifferent hard-sphere diameters and leads to a considerable improvement in\naccounting for the soft-core nature of the interatomic potential. As a specific\nexample, the radial distribution function and the equation of state for a\nLennard-Jones fluid (Argon) are compared with results from molecular dynamics\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2004 06:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 05:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 04:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-24"}

The\nspectral estimators used for this purpose are affected by a frequency dependent\nbias. The variances of the wavelet coefficients, however, match the power-law\nshaped spectra, which makes the wavelet estimator essentially unbiased. These\nscaling characteristics of the magnetic field data appear to be essentially\nnon-steady and intermittent. The scaling properties of bursty bulk flow (BBF)\nand non-BBF associated magnetic fluctuations are analysed with the aim of\nunderstanding processes of energy transfer between scales. Small-scale ($\\sim\n0.08-0.3$ s) magnetic fluctuations having the same scaling index $\\alpha \\sim\n2.6$ as the large-scale ($\\sim 0.7-5$ s) magnetic fluctuations occur during\nBBF-associated periods. During non-BBF associated periods the energy transfer\nto small scales is absent, and the large-scale scaling index $\\alpha \\sim 1.7$\nis closer to Kraichnan or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scalings. The anisotropy\ncharacteristics of magnetic fluctuations show both scale-dependent and\nscale-independent behavior. The former can be partly explained in terms of the\nGoldreich-Sridhar model of MHD turbulence, which leads to the picture of\nAlfv\\'{e}nic turbulence parallel and of eddy turbulence perpendicular to the\nmean magnetic field direction. Nonetheless, other physical mechanisms, such as\ntransverse magnetic structures, velocity shears, or boundary effects can\ncontribute to the anisotropy characteristics of plasma sheet turbulence.
