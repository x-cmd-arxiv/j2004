This is comparable to the\nclustering of 4L* early-type galaxies at z<1, and is consistent with the\nbrightest EROs being the progenitors of the most massive ellipticals.

The in\nsitu HMF measurements since 1960s show that the heliospheric current sheet\n(HCS) is systematically shifted (coned) southward during solar minimum times,\nleading to the concept of a bashful ballerina. While temporary shifts can be\nconsiderably larger, the average HCS shift (coning) angle is a few degrees,\nless than the $7.2^{\\circ}$ tilt of the solar rotation axis. Recent solar\nobservations during the last two solar cycles verify these results and show\nthat the magnetic areas in the northern solar hemisphere are larger and their\nintensity weaker than in the south during long intervals in the late declining\nto minimum phase. The multipole expansion reveals a strong quadrupole term\nwhich is oppositely directed to the dipole term. These results imply that the\nSun has a symmetric quadrupole S0 dynamo mode that oscillates in phase with the\ndominant dipole A0 mode. Moreover, the heliospheric magnetic field has a strong\ntendency to produce solar tilts that are roughly opposite in longitudinal\nphase. This implies is a systematic longitudinal asymmetry and leads to a\n\"flip-flop\" type behaviour in the dominant HMF sector whose period is about 3.2\nyears. This agrees very well with the similar flip-flop period found recently\nin sunspots, as well as with the observed ratio of three between the activity\ncycle period and the flip-flop period of sun-like stars. Accordingly, these\nresults require that the solar dynamo includes three modes, A0, S0 and a\nnon-axisymmetric mode. Obviously, these results have a great impact on solar\nmodelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 18:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

However, serious concern has been raised on the long-term\nconsistency of the aa index and on the centennial rise of the solar magnetic\nfield. Here we reanalyze geomagnetic activity during the last 100 years by\ncalculating the recently suggested IHV (Inter-Hour Variability) index as a\nmeasure of local geomagnetic activity for seven stations. We find that local\ngeomagnetic activity at all stations follows the same qualitative long-term\npattern: an increase from early 1900s to 1960, a dramatic dropout in 1960s and\na (mostly weaker) increase thereafter. Moreover, at all stations, the activity\nat the end of the 20th century has a higher average level than at the beginning\nof the century. This agrees with the result based on the aa index that global\ngeomagnetic activity, and thereby, the open solar magnetic field has indeed\nincreased during the last 100 years. However, quantitatively, the estimated\ncentennial increase varies greatly from one station to another. We find that\nthe relative increase is higher at the high-latitude stations and lower at the\nlow and mid-latitude stations. These differences may indicate that the fraction\nof solar wind disturbances leading to only moderate geomagnetic activity has\nincreased during the studied time interval. We also show that the IHV index\nneeds to be corrected for the long-term change of the daily curve, and\ncalculate the corrected IHV values. Most dramatically, we find the centennial\nincrease in global geomagnetic activity was considerably smaller, only about\none half of that depicted by the aa index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 19:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
