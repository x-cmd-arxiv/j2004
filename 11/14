UV luminosities of the\nbrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 M_sun to ~10^9 M_sun\nin young stars in the tails, and HI luminosities imply similar HI masses.\nUV-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as a\nfew Myr, and in all cases ages < 400Myr. Most of the young stars in the tails\nformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,\nand they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. Star formation appears to be\nolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from the\nparent galaxy. This could be because the star formation occurs progressively\nalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near the\ngalaxy/tail interface. The youngest stellar concentrations, usually near the\nends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarf\ngalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2004 18:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

That is why two nilpotent\nclass s groups are geometrically equivalent if and only if they have same\nquasi-identities ([Pl3]). Therefore, we can describe classes of geometrical\nequivalence of nilpotent groups instead of describing quasivarieties generated\nby single nilpotent group. The problem of geometrical equivalence can be\nresearched by the technique of approximation of groups ([Pl2]). In this paper\nonly nilpotent torsion free groups are considered. In the first part two\nsufficient conditions are presented (Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) when the\nnilpotent torsion free group is geometrically equivalent to its Mal'tsev\ncompletion and so it belongs to the same quasi-variety. In the second part of\nthis paper some results are achieved by the easy methods of approximation of\ngroups in the describing of classes of geometrical equivalence of nilpotent\nclass 2 torsion free groups with the small rank of center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2004 13:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The recently\nlaunched Gravity Probe B (GP-B) will test the predicted precession rate of 40.9\nmilliarc-seconds per year for a set of four gyroscopes in a Polar Earth Orbit\n(PEO). It may be possible, however, that the gravitomagnetic field from a\nrotating mass behaves in the same way as the magnetic field generated by a\nmoving charge. In that case the predicted precession rate of a gyroscope will\nbe zero, since the gyroscopes of GP-B have been shielded against external\nmagnetic fields. Another possible manifestation of the equivalence of\ngravitomagnetic and magnetic field may already have been found. It is the\nso-called Wilson Blackett law, approximately describing the magnetic field of\nmany rotating celestial bodies. In this work a review of the gravitomagnetic\napproach is given starting from the Einstein equations. Four gravitomagnetic\nequations, analogous to the Maxwell equations, are deduced. The Wilson Blackett\nrelation follows from these equations, if the gravitomagnetic field is\nidentified as a common magnetic field. In addition, the precession rate for a\ngyroscope in terms of the gravito-magnetic field has been derived, starting\nfrom the principle of general covariance. The gravitomagnetic field may again\nbe identified as a common magnetic field, or can be evaluated in the standard\nway. The future observations from GP-B may discriminate between the alternative\nchoices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2004 21:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
