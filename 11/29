Three energetic mechanisms\nare considered: multiple supernova explosions (SNe), a hypernova explosion\nassociated with a gamma ray burst (GRB), and the vertical impact of a high\nvelocity cloud (HVC). The total released energy has an upper limit of 10^54\nergs. We find that multiple SNe are in general more effective in producing\nshells that break out of the disk than a hypernova explosion of the same total\nenergy. As a consequence, multiple SNe form rings with a high ring-to-center\ncontrast K<100 in the HI column density, whereas single hypernova explosions\nform rings with K<10. Only multiple SNe can reproduce both the size (diameter\n\\~1.7 kpc) and the ring-to-center contrast (K ~ 15-20) of the HI ring in\nHoolmberg I. High velocity clouds create HI rings that are much smaller in size\n(< 0.8 kpc) and contrast (K < 4.5) than seen in Holmberg I. We construct model\nposition-velocity (pV) diagrams and find that they can be used to distinguish\namong different HI ring formation mechanisms. The observed pV-diagrams of\nHolmberg I are best reproduced by multiple SNe. We conclude that the giant HI\nring in Holmberg I is most probably formed by multiple SNe. We also find that\nthe appearance of the SNe-driven shell in the integrated HI image depends on\nthe inclination angle of the galaxy. In nearly face-on galaxies, the integrated\nHI image shows a ring of roughly constant HI column density surrounding a deep\ncentral depression, whereas in considerably inclined galaxies (i > 45 deg) the\nHI image is characterized by two kidney-shaped density enhancements and a mild\ncentral depression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2004 10:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Especially winds of high mass stars and\ndefinitely the on-set of the first super novae can remove the residual gas from\na cluster. This leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out of\nvirial equilibrium. Standard models predict that the star formation efficiency\n(SFE) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden (within one crossing-time of the\ncluster) gas expulsion to retain some of the stars in a bound cluster. If the\nefficiency is lower the stars of the cluster disperse completely. Recent\nobservations reveal that in strong star bursts star clusters do not form in\nisolation but in complexes containing dozens and up to several hundred star\nclusters (super-clusters). By carrying out numerical experiments we demonstrate\nthat in these environments (i.e. the deeper potential of the star cluster\ncomplex and the merging process of the star clusters within these\nsuper-clusters) the SFEs could be as low as 20 per cent, leaving a\ngravitationally bound stellar population. We demonstrate that the merging of\nthe first clusters happens faster than the dissolution time therefore enabling\nmore stars to stay bound within the merger object.
