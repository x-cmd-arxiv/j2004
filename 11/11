If there is a spiral density wave, nuclear ring, tidal arm, or other\nwell-defined stellar structure, then gravitational instabilities in the gaseous\ncomponent produce giant cloud complexes with a spacing of about three times the\nwidth. These gas complexes form star complexes, giving the familiar beads on a\nstring of star formation along spiral arms, or nuclear hotspots in the case of\na ring. Turbulence compression, supernovae, and self-gravitational contraction\ninside the giant clouds produce a nearly scale-free structure, including giant\nmolecular clouds that form OB associations and molecular cloud cores that form\nclusters.

The largest\ncoherent star-forming regions are the flocculent arms themselves. At the core\nof the hierarchy are the very dense clumps in which individual and binary stars\nform.

Using a two-dimensional atmospheric model we have performed the first\ncomputation of the effects upon the Earth's atmosphere of one such impulsive\nevent. A ten second burst delivering 100 kJ/m^2 to the Earth penetrates to the\nstratosphere and results in globally averaged ozone depletion of 35%, with\ndepletion reaching 55% at some latitudes. Significant global depletion persists\nfor over 5 years after the burst. This depletion would have dramatic\nimplications for life since a 50% decrease in ozone column density results in\napproximately three times the normal UVB flux. Widespread extinctions are\nlikely, based on extrapolation from UVB sensitivity of modern organisms.\nAdditional effects include a shot of nitrate fertilizer and NO2 opacity in the\nvisible providing a cooling perturbation to the climate over a similar\ntimescale. These results lend support to the hypothesis that a GRB may have\ninitiated the late Ordovician mass extinction (Melott et al. 2004).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2004 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2005 23:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The actual task is to develop principles for the spin\nmanipulations in spintronic devices. In this Report we suggest and verify\nexperimentally a concept of heteromagnetic semiconductor structures. It is\nbased on spin diffusion between layers of the nanostructure with different\nmagnetic properties and allows controlling the spin-switching rate for magnetic\nions. A ten times increase of spin-lattice relaxation rate of magnetic Mn-ions\nis achieved in (Zn,Mn)Se/(Be,Mn)Te heteromagnetic structures with an\ninhomogeneous distribution of Mn-ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2004 16:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

To study the characteristics of each of\nthese two kinds of perturbations, one has to determine the contribution of each\nto the anisotropy of CMB. For example, the ratio of the power spectra of\ntensor/scalar perturbations can be used to tighten bounds on the scalar\nspectral index. We investigate here the implications for the tensor/scalar\nratio of the recent discovery (noted in astro-ph/0410139) that the introduction\nof a minimal length cutoff in the structure of spacetime does not leave\nboundary terms invariant. Such a cutoff introduces an ambiguity in the choice\nof action for tensor and scalar perturbations, which in turn can affect this\nratio. We numerically solve for both tensor and scalar mode equations in a\nnear-de-sitter background and explicitly find the cutoff dependence of the\ntensor/scalar ratio during inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2004 22:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2004 20:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2005 17:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 May 2005 21:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The dust macroparticles are negatively charged, but are unmagnetized\nbecause of their high mass. The electrons are highly magnetized, and the ions\nhave intermediate magnetization. This results in different transport rates of\nthe different species across the magnetic field. Depending on the size of the\nmagnetic field, and the relative charge on the different species, the dust\ngrains can be the dominant current carrier. The space charge clouds near the\nelectrodes will then be determined by the relative mobility of the different\nspecies. The discharge can operate in one of two modes, a positive space charge\n(PSC) mode, characterized by a strong cathode fall, and a negative space charge\n(NSC) mode, characterized by a broad anode fall. Features unique to the dust\nparticles can also play a role in the structure of the discharge, such as the\nvariable equilibrium charge on the grains, dependent on the local potential and\nspecies temperatures, the effect of gravity on the grain dynamics, and the rate\nof charging of the grains. The dust grains can also form an ordered structure,\nthe dust-plasma crystal. A fluid model of the different species is used to\ncalculate the structure of the resulting discharge, incorporating the above\neffects. The transition from the PSC mode to the NSC mode as the magnetic\nfield, pressure and dust properties are varied is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 2004 09:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
