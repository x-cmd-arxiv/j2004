Ten of the 13 targets have close planetary\ncompanions. All of the stars observed at the CFHT show long-term (months to\nyears) changes in H & K intensity levels. Four stars display short-term (days)\ncyclical activity. For two, HD 73256 and kappa^1 Ceti, the activity is likely\nassociated with an active region rotating with the star, however, the flaring\nin excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with a hot jupiter. A\nplanetary companion remains a possibility for kappa^1 Ceti. For the other two,\nHD 179949 and upsilon And, the cyclic variation is synchronized to the hot\njupiter's orbit. For both stars this synchronicity with the orbit is clearly\nseen in two out of three epochs. The effect is only marginal in the third epoch\nat which the seasonal level of chromospheric activity had changed for both\nstars. Short-term chromospheric activity appears weakly dependent on the mean\nK-line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars. Also, a suggestive\ncorrelation exists between this activity and the M_p sin(i) of the star's hot\njupiter. Because of their small separation (<= 0.1 AU), many of the hot\njupiters lie within the Alfv\\'en radius of their host stars which allows a\ndirect magnetic interaction with the stellar surface.

However, the damping times of these oscillations are typically very\nshort (from one to a few periods) and the physical mechanism responsible for\nthe decay is still a matter of debate.

As an\noutcome, all physical observables should be independent of the choice of the\ncovariant gauge parameter. The most systematic scheme to solve quantum field\ntheories (QFT) is perturbation theory where the above-mentioned identities are\nsatisfied at every order of approximation.

As it stands, not all natural phenomena are\nrealized in the perturbative regime of QFTs. Therefore, one is inevitably led\nto make efforts to solve these theories in a non perturbative fashion. A\nnatural starting point for such studies in the continuum are the\nSchwinger-Dyson Equations (SDE). One of the most undesirable features\nassociated with their non perturbative truncation is the loss of highly and\nrightly esteemed gauge invariance rendering the predictions less reliable.\nArguably, the only hope we have to recuperate the credibility of the results is\nto employ only such truncation schemes which yield predictions that match onto\nthe blindly reliable perturbative ones at every order of approximation.

We do so using the boundary effective action\nformalism of hep-th/0401164 which accounts quantitatively for the cosmological\nvacuum ambiguity. In this formalism we can clearly 1) delineate the validity of\ncosmological effective actions in an expanding universe. The corollary of the\ninitial state ambiguity is the existence of an earliest time. The inability of\nan effective action to describe physics before this time demands that one sets\ninitial conditions on the earliest time hypersurface. A calculation then shows\nthat CMB anisotropy measurements are generically sensitive to high energy\ncorrections to the initial conditions. 2) We compute the one-loop contribution\nto the stress-tensor due to high-energy physics corrections to an arbitrary\ncosmological initial state. We find that phenomenological bounds on the\nbackreaction do not lead to strong constraints on the coefficient of the\nleading boundary irrelevant operator. Rather, we find that the power spectrum\nitself is the quantity most sensitive to initial state corrections. 3) The\ncomputation of the one-loop backreaction confirms arguments that irrelevant\ncorrections to the Bunch-Davies initial state yield non-adiabatic vacua\ncharacterized by an energy excess at some earlier time. However, this excess\nonly dominates over the classical background at times before the `earliest\ntime' at which the effective action is valid.

We point out that the\nMichelson-Morley experiment revealed the interference of photons, however, it\ndid not reveal the photons simultaneous arrival at the beam splitter. According\nto the de Broglie-Bohm picture, the quantum potential nonlocally determines the\ninterference of photons. The interference of the photons is not governed by the\narrival time of the photons; rather, it is governed by the quantum potential.\nTherefore, there is a possibility for another interpretation of the\nMichelson-Morley experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2004 02:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

FFAG magnets are naturally wide; low momentum muons move\nfrom the low field side of a gradient magnet to the high field side as they\ngain energy. This can be exploited to do double duty and allow a large beam\nadmittance without unduly increasing the magnetic field volume. If the amount\nof RF must be reduced to optimize cost, an FFAG ring can accommodate extra\norbits. I describe both scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet are\nenergy independent and non-scaling FFAGs in which the bends in each magnet do\nvary with muon energy. In all FFAG designs the sum of the bends in groups of\nmagnets are constant; otherwise orbits would not close. Ways of keeping the\naccelerating beam in phase with the RF are described.

In a realistic setup the localization for\nmixed states is robust and experimentally accessible, and we discuss\napplications to superselection rules. For an ideal setup and initial Fock\nstates we show how a relational Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat state emerges, and\ninvestigate circumstances under which such a state is destroyed. In our second\nexample we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two Bose\nEinstein condensates, looking particularly at the build up of spatial\ninterference patterns, an area which has attracted much attention since the\nwork of Javanainen and Yoo. We show that the relative phase localizes much\nfaster than was intimated in previous studies focusing on the emerging\ninterference pattern itself.
