The collimation of the\nnonthermal filaments may be done in the colliding wind region by the ionized\nsurface of individual mass-losing stars of massive binary systems.

Such a model may prove useful for\nquantitative studies of tissue aging and the emergence of cancer. We consider\ntwo modes of chromosome segregation: (1) Random segregation, where the daughter\nchromosomes of a given parent chromosome segregate randomly into the stem cell\nand its differentiating sister cell. (2) ``Immortal DNA strand''\nco-segregation, for which the stem cell retains the daughter chromosomes with\nthe oldest parent strands. Immortal strand co-segregation is a mechanism,\noriginally proposed by Cairns (J. Cairns, {\\it Nature} {\\bf 255}, 197 (1975)),\nby which stem cells preserve the integrity of their genomes. For random\nsegregation, we develop an ordered strand pair formulation of the dynamics,\nanalogous to the ordered strand pair formalism developed for quasispecies\ndynamics involving semiconservative replication with imperfect lesion repair\n(in this context, lesion repair is taken to mean repair of postreplication\nbase-pair mismatches). Interestingly, a similar formulation is possible with\nimmortal strand co-segregation, despite the fact that this segregation\nmechanism is age-dependent. From our model we are able to mathematically show\nthat, when lesion repair is imperfect, then immortal strand co-segregation\nleads to better preservation of the stem cell lineage than random chromosome\nsegregation. Furthermore, our model allows us to estimate the optimal lesion\nrepair efficiency for preserving an adult stem cell population for a given\nperiod of time. For human stem cells, we obtain that mispaired bases still\npresent after replication and cell division should be left untouched, to avoid\npotentially fixing a mutation in both DNA strands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Nov 2004 06:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
