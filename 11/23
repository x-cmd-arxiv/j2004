The self-force produces two types of effect. The first is a\ntime-changing inertial mass, and this is calculated exactly for a particle at\nrest relative to the cosmological fluid. We show that for certain cosmological\nmodels, the mass decreases and then increases back to its original value. For\nall other models except de Sitter spacetime, the mass is restored only to a\nfraction of its original value. For de Sitter spacetime the mass steadily\ndecreases. The second effect is a deviation relative to geodesic motion, and we\ncalculate this for a charge that moves slowly relative to the dust in a\nmatter-dominated cosmology.

The vanishing of the\nvacuum energy requires that their masses lie below {m_{3/2} M_{Pl}}^{1/2},\nwhich for m_{3/2}=O(TeV) sets a bound of 10^{10-13} GeV.

From the different characteristics of\nparticles, the particle sizes can be obtained. In this paper, three sizes: the\nstatic radius $R_{s}$, the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$ and the apparent\nhydrodynamic radius $R_{h,app}$ are discussed using dilute water dispersions of\nhomogenous spherical particles poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, with a\nsimple assumption that the hydrodynamic radius is in proportion to the static\nradius, when Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid. Our results show that\nthe expected values of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the\nscattered light intensity are consistent with the experimental data very well\nand the difference between the static radius and the apparent hydrodynamic\nradius is large and the difference between the hydrodynamic radius and the\napparent hydrodynamic radius is influenced by the particle size distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2004 07:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2004 07:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is therefore important to understand how the\nproperties of coding at the level of neuronal populations are determined by the\ndynamics of single neuron AP generation. Here we analyze how the AP generating\nmechanism determines the speed with which an ensemble of neurons can represent\ntransient stochastic input signals.
