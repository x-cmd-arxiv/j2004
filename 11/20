The approach of the method is closest to the\nboundary element methods, although significant conceptual differences exist\nwith respect to this class of methods. The method achieves equipotentiality of\nconducting surfaces by iterative non-local charge transfer. For each of the\nconducting surfaces non-local charge transfers are performed between surface\nelements which differ the most from the targeted equipotentiality of the\nsurface. The method is tested against analytical solutions and its wide range\nof application is demonstrated. The method has appealing technical\ncharacteristics. For the problem with N surface elements, the computational\ncomplexity of the method essentially scales with N^alpha, where alpha < 2, the\nrequired computer memory scales with N, while the error of the potential\ndecreases exponentially with the number of iterations for many orders of\nmagnitude of the error, without the presence of the Critical Slowing Down. The\nRobin Hood method has a large potential of application in other classical as\nwell as quantum problems.

Yet\ndespite exhibiting sustained viral loads below the level of detection, a number\nof these patients experience unexplained episodes of transient viremia or viral\n\"blips\". We propose here that transient activation of the immune system by\nopportunistic infection may explain these episodes of viremia. Indeed, immune\nactivation by opportunistic infection may spur HIV replication, replenish viral\nreservoirs and contribute to accelerated disease progression. In order to\ninvestigate the effects of concurrent infection on chronically infected HIV\npatients under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we\nextend a simple dynamic model of the effects of vaccination on HIV infection\n[Jones and Perelson, JAIDS 31:369-377, 2002] to include growing pathogens. We\nthen propose a more realistic model for immune cell expansion in the presence\nof pathogen, and include this in a set of competing models that allow low\nbaseline viral loads in the presence of drug treatment. Programmed expansion of\nimmune cells upon exposure to antigen is a feature not previously included in\nHIV models, and one that is especially important to consider when simulating an\nimmune response to opportunistic infection. Using these models we show that\nviral blips with realistic duration and amplitude can be generated by\nconcurrent infections in HAART treated patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2004 20:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}
