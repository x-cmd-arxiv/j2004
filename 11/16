Since 21 cm fluctuations are significantly contaminated by\nforegrounds, such as galactic synchrotron or low-frequency radio point sources,\nthe lack of a significant non-Gaussianity in the signal suggests that any\nsignificant detection of a non-Gaussianity can be due to foregrounds.\nSimilarly, in addition to frequency information that is now proposed to\nseparate 21 cm fluctuations from foregrounds, if the non-Gaussian structure of\nforegrounds is a priori known, one can potentially use this additional\ninformation to further reduce the confusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 01:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-06-15"}

The late-type nature of\none of the candidates, OTS 44, is confirmed through the detection of strong\nsteam absorption bands. The other object, OTS 7, exhibits no late-type features\nand is likely a background star or galaxy. The gravity-sensitive shape of the\nH- and K-band continua demonstrate that OTS 44 is a young, pre-main-sequence\nobject rather than a field dwarf. We measure a spectral type of M9.5 for OTS 44\nbased on a comparison of its spectrum to data for optically-classified young\nlate-type objects. Because OTS 44 is the coolest and faintest object with\nconfirmed membership in Chamaeleon I, it is very likely the least massive known\nmember of the cluster. By comparing the position of OTS 44 on the H-R diagram\nto the evolutionary models of Chabrier & Baraffe, we infer a mass of ~0.015\nM_sun. Although this estimate is uncertain by at least a factor of two, OTS 44\nis nevertheless one of the least massive free-floating brown dwarfs confirmed\nspectroscopically to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 14:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Fundamentally, BON encodes the\ninformation about each node's available computational resources in the\nstructure of the links connecting the nodes in the network. This distributed\nencoding is self-organized, with each node managing its in-degree and local\nconnectivity via random-walk sampling. Assignment of incoming jobs to nodes\nwith the most free resources is also accomplished by sampling the nodes via\nshort random walks. Extensive simulations show that the resulting highly\ndynamic and self-organized graph structure can efficiently balance\ncomputational load throughout large-scale networks. These simulations cover a\nwide spectrum of cases, including significant heterogeneity in available\ncomputing resources and high burstiness in incoming load. We provide analytical\nresults that prove BON's scalability for truly large-scale networks: in\nparticular we show that under certain ideal conditions, the network structure\nconverges to Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graphs; our simulation results, however,\nshow that the algorithm does much better, and the structures seem to approach\nthe ideal case of d-regular random graphs.

We discuss\nthe possibility of using a modified version of perturbation theory which relies\non a large field cutoff and has been successfully applied to the double-well\npotential (Y. M., PRL 88 141601). Generically, in the case of scalar field\ntheory, the weak coupling expansion is unable to reproduce the exponential\nsuppression of the large field configurations. This problem can be solved by\nintroducing a large field cutoff. The value of this cutoff can be chosen to\nreduce the discrepancy with the original problem. This optimization can be\napproximately performed using the strong coupling expansion and bridges the gap\nbetween the two expansions. We report recent attempts to extend this procedure\nfor SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice. We compare gauge invariant and gauge\ndependent (in the Landau gauge) criteria to sort the configurations into\n``large-field'' and ``small-field'' configurations. %We discuss the effects of\ndiscarding the large field configurations. We discuss the convergence of\nlattice perturbation theory and the way it can be modified in order to obtain\nresults similar to the scalar case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2004 23:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These are techniques\nused in the analysis of the quantum many-body problem, and are instances of\nso-called boson expansion methods. A generalised Dyson boson-fermion mapping is\na one-to-one linear but non-unitary operator that can be applied to vectors\nrepresenting the states of a many-fermion system. A vector representing a\nfermion system maps onto a vector that represents a state of a many-body system\nthat contains both bosons and fermions. The motivation for doing such a mapping\nis the hope that it will reveal some property of the system that simplifies its\nanalysis and that was hidden in the original form. The aims of this text are to\nreview the theory of generalized Dyson boson-fermion mappings and to find a\nuseful application for a generalized Dyson boson-fermion mapping, by\nconsidering a non-trivial model, namely the Richardson model for\nsuperconductivity. It is the first time that a boson expansion technique is\nimplemented for a system where the roles of both collective and non-collective\nfermion pairs are important. The Dyson mapping uncovers non-trivial properties\nof the system that aid the construction of time-independent as well as\ntime-dependent perturbation expansions. The time-independent expansions agree\nwith results that other authors have obtained through methods other than boson\nexpansions.

Annotated protein sequences available\nfrom the SWISS-PROT database were analyzed for thirteen eukaryotes, eight\nbacteria, and two archaea species.

Our attention is focused on\nthe case where qubit-environment interactions induce the decoherence with\npopulation decay. We assume that the environment consists of a set of bosonic\nexcitations. The time evolution of the reduced density matrix for the qubit is\ncalculated in the presence of periodic short pi pulses. We confirm that the\ndecoherence is suppressed if the pulse interval is shorter than the correlation\ntime for qubit-environment interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Nov 2004 17:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In this work we consider exact population transfers that\nminimize the L^2 norm of the control which is typically the amplitude of an\nelectromagnetic field. This problem is analytically and numerically\nchallenging. Except for few exactly solvable cases, there is no general\nunderstanding of the nature of optimal controls and trajectories. We find that\nby examining the limit of large transfer times, we can uncover such general\nproperties. In particular, for transfer times large with respect to the time\nscale of the free dynamics of the quantum system, the optimal control is a sum\nof components, each being a Bohr frequency sinusoid modulated by a slow\namplitude, i.e. a profile that changes considerably only on the scale of the\ntransfer time. Moreover, we show that the optimal trajectory follows a \"mean''\nevolution modulated by the fast free dynamics of the system. The calculation of\nthe \"mean'' optimal trajectory and the slow control profiles is done via an\n\"averaged'' two-point boundary value problem which we derive and which is much\neasier to solve than the one expressing the necessary conditions for optimality\nof the original optimal transfer problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2004 01:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
