Unlike the case of infinite sheets, such configurations do not\nconstitute equilibrium states but instead are subject to global collapse unless\ncountered by pressure forces or rotation. The initial effect of finite geometry\nis to promote concentrations of material at the edges of the sheet. If the\nsheet is not perfectly circular, gravitational focussing results in enhanced\nconcentrations of mass. In the second-most simple geometry, that of an\nelliptical outer boundary, the general result is collapse to a filamentary\nstructure with the densest concentrations of mass at the ends of the filament.\nWe suggest that these simple calculations have interesting implications for the\ngravitational evolution of overall molecular cloud structure, envisioning that\nsuch clouds might originate as roughly sheetlike sections of gas accumulated as\na result of large-scale flows in the local interstellar medium. We show some\nexamples of local clouds with overall filamentary shape and denser\nconcentrations of mass and star clusters near the ends of the overall extended\nstructure, suggestive of our simple ellipse collapse calculations. We suggest\nthat cluster-forming gas is often concentrated as a result of gravity acting on\nirregular boundaries; this mechanism can result in very rapid infall of gas\nwhich may be of importance to the formation of massive stars. This picture\nsuggests that much of the supersonic ``turbulence'' observed in molecular\nclouds might be gravitationally-generated. Our results may provide impetus for\nfurther theoretical explorations of global gravitational effects in molecular\nclouds and their implications for generating the substructure needed for\nfragmentation into stars and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2004 18:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Stellar light contributes relatively more to the\nMIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (Tstar ~4000 K) because the\nemission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal\nradiation. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find\nthat the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is\nthat of the inner disk wall: In high-Tstar models, the dust destruction radius\nis much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes\nrelatively more to the 2-10 um flux.

However, at present it is hard to know whether the on-going X-ray\nsurveys are providing a reliable and nearly complete census of the Type II\nquasar population. In order to address this open issue and shed light on the\nbroad-band properties of Type II quasars, we used the sample of 291\nhigh-ionization narrow emission-line AGN at z=0.3-0.83 selected from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey by Zakamska et al. (2003). Using archival X-ray information,\nwe were able to place constraints on the X-ray emission of 17 of these objects\n(three X-ray detections and 14 upper limits). Using the [O III]5007 line\nluminosities to predict the intrinsic X-ray power of the AGN, we found that at\nleast 47% of the objects in the observed sample provides evidence for the\npresence of X-ray absorption (with N_H>10^22 cm^-2), including the four highest\nluminosity sources with predicted unobscured luminosities of ~10^45 erg/s. For\nthe only source with moderate-quality XMM-Newton spectral data, all of the\npieces of the puzzle (2-10 keV luminosity of ~4x10^44 erg/s, N_H~1-3x10^22\ncm^-2, and unobscured magnitude M_B=-26 assure that this is a genuine Type II\nquasar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2004 20:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main effect of this excess is\nto reduce the density and thus luminosity of the intragroup gas. Given this,\ngroups should also should show a steep relationship between X-ray luminosity\nand velocity dispersion. However, previous work suggests that this is not the\ncase with many measuring slopes flatter than the cluster relation.\n  Examining the group L_X:\\sigma relation shows that much of the flattening is\ncaused by a small subset of groups which show very high X-ray luminosities for\ntheir velocity dispersions (or vice versa).\n  Detailed Chandra study of two such groups shows that earlier ROSAT results\nwere subject to significant (~30-40%) point source contamination, but confirm\nthat a significant hot IGM is present in these groups, although these are two\nof the coolest systems in which intergalactic X-ray emission has been detected.\n  Their X-ray properties are shown to be broadly consistent with those of other\ngalaxy groups, although the gas entropy in NGC 1587 is unusually low, and its\nX-ray luminosity correspondingly high for its temperature, compared to most\ngroups.\n  This leads us to suggest that the velocity dispersion in these systems has\nbeen reduced in some way, and we consider how this might have come about.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2004 12:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For the oxidation process of late transition metals (TM),\nrecent experimental and theoretical studies provided a quite intriguing\natomic-scale insight: The formed initial oxidic overlayers are not merely few\natomic-layer thin versions of the known bulk oxides, but can exhibit structural\nand electronic properties that are quite distinct to the surfaces of both the\ncorresponding bulk metals and bulk oxides.

Beyond complete evaporation,\nthe evolution of the quantum state past the Cauchy horizon cannot remain\nunitary, raising the questions: How can this evolution be described as a\nquantum map, and how is causality preserved? What are the possible effects of\nsuch nonstandard quantum evolution maps on the behavior of the entangled\nlaboratory partner? More generally, the laws of quantum evolution under extreme\nconditions in remote regions (not just in evaporating black-hole interiors, but\npossibly near other naked singularities and regions of extreme spacetime\nstructure) remain untested by observation, and might conceivably be non-unitary\nor even nonlinear, raising the same questions about the evolution of entangled\nstates. The answers to these questions are subtle, and are linked in unexpected\nways to the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. We show that terrestrial\nexperiments can be designed to probe and constrain exactly how the laws of\nquantum evolution might be altered, either by black-hole evaporation, or by\nother extreme processes in remote regions possibly governed by unknown physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2004 08:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In\nthis time Weyl's understanding of the constitution of matter and its\nmathematical description changed considerably. At the beginning of the period\nhe started from a \"dynamistic\" and geometrical conception of matter, following\nand extending the Mie-Hilbert approch, which he gave up during the year 1920.\nAfter transitional experiments with a singularity (and in this sense\ntopological) approach in 1921/22, he developed an open perspective of what he\ncalled an ``agency theory'' of matter. The idea for it was formulated already\nbefore the advent of the ``new'' quantum mechanics in 1925/26. It turned out to\nbe well suited to be taken over to the quantum view as a kind of ``heritage''\nfrom the first half of the decade. At the end of the period, Weyl completely\nrenounced his earlier belief in the possibility to ``construct matter'' from a\ngeometrically unified field theory.
