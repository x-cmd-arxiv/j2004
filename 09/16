The method is based on\nthe discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) on compact Lie groups, and the use of\ncontinuous extension of the inverse discrete transforms to approximate the\ndiscrete EAS images by continuous EAS brightness distribution functions. Here\nwe describe the FT-method in case of SU(3) group. It allows practical\nrealization of the DFT technique for functions sampled on hexagonal symmetry\ngrids. The proposed method can also be implemented in case of IACT cameras with\ngrids of rectangular symmetry by using the DFT on the SU(2)xSU(2) group. The\nproposed FT-method is applied to the Monte-Carlo simulated bank of TeV proton\nand gamma-ray EAS images for a stand-alone telescope. Comparing between the\nFT-method and the currently used standard method shows that the FT technique\nallows a better and systematic enhancement of the gamma-ray signal. The\nrelative difference between these two methods becomes more profound especially\nfor `photon poor' images. It suggests that the EAS detection thresholds of\nIACTs could be effectively reduced with the use of FT technique. This\nprediction is further supported by a significant noise suppression capability\nof the method using simple low-pass filters in the image frequency domain. The\nFT-method allows very deep `tail' (and `height') image cuts, differentiation of\nimages, operations in the image frequency domain, etc., that can be used for\ndevelopment of new effective parameters for the EAS image processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2004 22:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The formalism\nis relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted\nby binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for\ngravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a\nclean separation of the three relevant scales: r_s, the size of the compact\nobjects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation\n(where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is\nsystematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals\ninto near zones and radiation zones. We show that the renormalization of\nultraviolet divergences which arise at v^6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations\nrequires the presence of two non-minimal worldline gravitational couplings\nlinear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a\nredefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences at arising at v^6\nhave no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features\nare encoded in the coefficients of non-minimal couplings, this implies a simple\nproof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least\norder v^6. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules\nof the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are\nquadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, do not\nplay a role until order v^10. These operators, which encapsulate finite size\nproperties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching\ncalculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT\nallows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in v.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2004 16:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2005 06:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Can the present autoantibody repertoire be consulted\nto predict resistance or susceptibility to the future development of an\nautoimmune disease? Here we developed an antigen microarray chip and used\nbioinformatic analysis to study a model of type 1 diabetes developing in\nnon-obese diabetic (NOD) male mice in which the disease was accelerated and\nsynchronized by exposing the mice to cyclophosphamide at 4 weeks of age. We\nobtained sera from 19 individual mice, treated the mice to induce\ncyclophosphamide-accelerated diabetes (CAD), and found, as expected, that 9\nmice became severely diabetic while 10 mice permanently resisted diabetes. We\nagain obtained serum from each mouse afterCAD induction. We then analyzed the\npatterns of antibodies in the individualmice to 266 different antigens spotted\non the antigen chip. We identified a select panel of 27 different antigens (10%\nof the array) that revealed a pattern of IgG antibody reactivity in the pre-CAD\nserathat discriminated between the mice resistant or susceptible to CAD with\n100% sensitivity and 82% specificity (p=0.017). Surprisingly, the set of IgG\nantibodies that was informative before CAD induction did not separate the\nresistant and susceptible groups after the onset of CAD; new antigens became\ncriticalfor post-CAD repertoire discrimination. Thus, at least for a model\ndisease, present antibody repertoires can predict future disease; predictive\nand diagnostic repertoires can differ; and decisive information about immune\nsystem behavior can be mined by bioinformatic technology. Repertoires matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2004 07:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Initially, the relative phase is totally undefined,\nand no interference effect takes place in the first position measurement.
