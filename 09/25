Our\nanalysis employs a minimum of priors and exploits the complementary nature of\nthese data sets. We examine a series of dark energy models with up to three\nfree parameters: the current dark energy equation of state w_0, the early time\nequation of state w_et and the scale factor at transition, a_t. From a combined\nanalysis of all three data sets, assuming a constant equation of state and that\nthe Universe is flat, we measure w_0=-1.05+0.10-0.12. Including w_et as a free\nparameter and allowing a_t to vary over the range 0.5<a_t<0.95 where the data\nsets have discriminating power, we measure w_0=-1.27+0.33-0.39 and\nw_et=-0.66+0.44-0.62. We find no significant evidence for evolution in the dark\nenergy equation of state parameter with redshift. Marginal hints of evolution\nin the supernovae data become less significant when the cluster constraints are\nalso included in the analysis. The complementary nature of the data sets leads\nto a tight constraint on the mean matter density, Omega_m and alleviates a\nnumber of other parameter degeneracies, including that between the scalar\nspectral index n_s, the physical baryon density Omega_bh^2 and the optical\ndepth tau. This complementary nature also allows us to examine models in which\nwe drop the prior on the curvature. For non-flat models with a constant\nequation of state, we measure w_0=-1.09+0.12-0.15 and Omega_de=0.70+-0.03. Our\nanalysis includes spatial perturbations in the dark energy fluid, assuming a\nsound speed c_s^2 =1. For our most general dark energy model, not including\nsuch perturbations would lead to spurious constraints on w_et which would be\ntighter by approximately a factor two with the current data.

The relation between thermal and shot noise induced\nby the source-drain voltage $V_{bias}$ is found when the SET operates in a\nregime tending to thermodynamic equilibrium far from resonance. The\nequilibration of electron-phonon subsystems produces broadening and doublet\nsplitting of transparency resonances helping to explain a negative differential\nresistance (NDR)of current versus voltage (I-V) curves. Mismatch between the\nelectron and phonon temperatures brings out the bouncing-ball mode in the\ncrossover regime close to the internal vibrations mode. The shuttle mechanism\noccurs at a threshold $V_{bias}$ of the order of the Coulomb energy $U_c$. An\naccumulation of charge is followed by the Coulomb blockade and broken symmetry\nof a single or double well potential. The Landau bifurcation cures the\nshuttling instability and the resonance levels of the quantum dot become split\nbecause of molecular tunneling.

In this paper we describe an\napplication of the sparse field method for solving level set equations in 3D\nplasma etching simulations. Sparse field method itself, developed by Whitaker\n[3] and broadly used in image processing community, is an alternative to the\nusual combination of narrow band and fast marching procedures for the\ncomputationally effective solving of level set equations. The obtained results\nfor convex and non-convex Hamiltonians show correct behavior of etching\nprofiles in simple model cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2004 06:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In kinetic terms water and\nchaperones may make the punctuated equilibrium of conformational changes less\npunctuated and help protein relaxation. Finally, water and chaperones may help\nthe convergence of multiple energy landscapes during protein-macromolecule\ninteractions. We also discuss the possibility of the introduction of protein\ngames to narrow the multitude of the energy landscapes when a protein binds to\nanother macromolecule. Both water and chaperones provide a diffuse set of\nrapidly fluctuating weak links (low affinity and low probability interactions),\nwhich allow the generalization of all these statements to a multitude of\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 2004 11:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2005 13:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Of course, many valiant efforts have been made to extend\nhis relativity to rigid bodies, but this subject is forgotten in history. This\nis largely because of the emergence of quantum mechanics with wave-particle\nduality. Instead of Lorentz-boosting rigid bodies, we now boost waves and have\nto deal with Lorentz transformations of waves. We now have some understanding\nof plane waves or running waves in the covariant picture, but we do not yet\nhave a clear picture of standing waves. In this report, we show that there is\none set of standing waves which can be Lorentz-transformed while being\nconsistent with all physical principle of quantum mechanics and relativity. It\nis possible to construct a representation of the Poincar\\'e group using\nharmonic oscillator wave functions satisfying space-time boundary conditions.\nThis set of wave functions is capable of explaining the quantum bound state for\nboth slow and fast hadrons. In particular it can explain the quark model for\nhadrons at rest, and Feynman's parton model hadrons moving with a speed close\nto that of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2004 23:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
