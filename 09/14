When averaged over the range 0.3<z<2.2 we find\nthat xi(s) is flat on small scales, steepening on scales above ~25h-1Mpc. In a\nWMAP/2dF cosmology we find a best fit power law with s_0=5.48+0.42-0.48h-1Mpc\nand gamma=1.20+-0.10 on scales s=1-25h-1Mpc. A CDM model assuming WMAP/2dF\ncosmological parameters is a good description of the QSO xi(s) after accounting\nfor non-linear clustering and z-space distortions, and a linear bias of\nb_qso(z=1.35)=2.02+-0.07. We subdivide the 2QZ into 10 redshift intervals from\nz=0.53 to 2.48 and find a significant increase in clustering amplitude at high\nredshift in the WMAP/2dF cosmology. We derive the bias of the QSOs which is a\nstrong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 and\nb_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. We use these bias values to derive the mean dark\nmatter halo (DMH) mass occupied by the QSOs.

If the relation between black hole (BH) mass and M_DH or host velocity\ndispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency\n(L/L_edd) for L* QSOs is approximately constant with redshift. Thus the fading\nof the QSO population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive BHs being\nactive at low redshift.

For one set of solar models (EMLT and ECGM models), the atmosphere\nis gray and assumes Eddington's approximation.

The mixing-length parameter in the model atmosphere is\nchosen so as to provide a good agreement between synthetic and observed Balmer\nline profiles, while the mixing-length parameter in the interior model is\ncalibrated so that the model reproduces the solar radius at solar age. For the\nMLT treatment, the rates P do depend significantly on the properties of the\natmosphere. On the other hand, for the CGM treatment, differences in P between\nthe ECGM and the KCGM models are very small compared to the error bars attached\nto the seismic measurements. The excitation rates P for modes from the EMLT\nmodel are significantly under-estimated compared with the solar seismic\nconstraints.

The finding is also in agreement with our detailed\nmodeling of a Type Ia supernova in the nebular phase. In these models, the\nincreased importance of the near-IR is a temperature effect. We note that this\ncomplicates late-time studies where often only the V band is well monitored. In\nparticular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows the\nbolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on such\nassumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. A\nvery simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well account\nfor the observations. The nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of this\nlight curve is lower than found from the peak brightness, providing an estimate\nof the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observed\nwavelength range. Our detailed models show the signature of an infrared\ncatastrophe at these epochs, which is not supported by the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2004 15:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The multi-frequency polarization data have been\nsuccessfully modeled by considering magneto-ionic Faraday screens at the\nsurface of the molecular clouds. Faraday rotated background emission adds to\nforeground emission towards these screens in a different way than in its\nsurroundings. The physical size of the Faraday screens is of the order of 2 pc\nfor 140 pc distance to the Taurus clouds.

With observational constraints for the thermal\nelectron density from H-alpha observations of less than 0.8 cm^-3 we conclude\nthat the regular magnetic field strength along the line of sight exceeds 20\nmuG.

For instance,\nuniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved\nspacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a\nbackground-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead\nsome to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of\nparticle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still,\nit is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed\nubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in\nexperimental high-energy physics, or \"particle\"-physics. Here we offer an\nelement of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist\n--strictly speaking-- two distinct notions of particles: globally defined\n$n$-particle Fock-states and *local particle states*. The last describe the\nphysical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates\nof local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are\nappropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak\ntopology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for\nflat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects\nin realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two\npoints of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of\nlocal particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional\nglobal particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role\nin quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2004 14:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 22:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}
