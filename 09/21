However, one has to reconsider the fundamental\nprinciples of Statistical Mechanics especially its key quantity, entropy.\nWhereas in conventional Thermostatistics the homogeneity and extensivity of the\nsystem and the concavity of its entropy S(E) are central conditions, these fail\nfor the systems considered here. E.g. at phase separation the entropy S(E) is\nnecessarily convex to make e^{S(E)-E/T} bimodal in E (the two coexisting\nphases). This is so even for normal macroscopic systems with short-range\ncoupling. As inhomogeneities and surface effects in particular cannot be scaled\naway,one has to be careful with the standard arguments of splitting a system\ninto two or bringing two systems into thermal contact. Not only the volume part\nof the entropy must be considered.

Next, we discuss\npossible low-energy signals for Split Supersymmetry. The absence of new light\nscalars removes all the phenomenological difficulties of low-energy\nsupersymmetry, associated with one-loop flavor and CP violating effects.\nHowever, the electric dipole moments of leptons and quarks do arise at two\nloops, and are automatically at the level of present limits with no need for\nsmall phases, making them accessible to several ongoing new-generation\nexperiments. We also study proton decay in the context of Split Supersymmetry,\nand point out scenarios where the dimension-six induced decays may be\nobservable.

Important\ntopical applications, in particular in high energy particle physics and\ncosmology, involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or\nthermal equilibrium. In these cases, standard approaches based on small\ndeviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying\nkinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect\nthe far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal\nequilibrium at late times. Understanding the ``link'' between the early- and\nthe late-time behavior of quantum fields is crucial for a wide range of\nphenomena. For the first time questions such as the explosive particle\nproduction at the end of the inflationary universe, including the subsequent\nprocess of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first\nprinciples. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional\nintegral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for\nwhich powerful nonperturbative approximation schemes are available. Here we\ngive an introduction to these techniques and show how they can be applied in\npractice. Though we focus on particle physics and cosmology applications, we\nemphasize that these techniques can be equally applied to other nonequilibrium\nphenomena in complex many body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2004 18:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-04"}

A novel feature found in the study of\nthe HV solitons is that their stability intervals never reach the (cutoff)\npoint at which the bright vortex carries over into a dark one, hence dark HV\nsolitons can never be stable, contrarily to the bright ones. In addition to the\nwell-known symmetry-breaking (\\textit{external}) instability, which splits the\nring soliton into a set of fragments flying away in tangential directions, we\nreport two new scenarios of the development of weak instabilities specific to\nthe HV solitons. One features \\textit{charge flipping}, with the two components\nexchanging the angular momentum and periodically reversing the sign of their\nspins. The composite soliton does not split in this case, therefore we identify\nsuch instability as an \\textit{intrinsic} one. Eventually, the soliton splits,\nas weak radiation loss drives it across the border of the ordinary strong\n(external) instability. Another scenario proceeds through separation of the\nvortex cores in the two components, each individual core moving toward the\nouter edge of the annular soliton. After expulsion of the cores, there remains\na zero-vorticity breather with persistent internal vibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2004 02:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The discreetness of\nspace-time structure is determined by a condition that mimics the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relations and the motion in this space-time model is chosen as\nsimple as possible. From these two assumptions we define a path-entropy that\nmeasures the number of closed paths associated with a given energy of the\nsystem preparation. This entropy has a dynamical character and depends on the\ntime interval on which we count the paths. We show that it exists an\nlike-equilibrium condition for which the path-entropy corresponds exactly to\nthe usual thermodynamic entropy and, more generally, the usual statistical\nthermodynamics is reobtained. This result derived without using the Gibbs\nensemble method shows that the standard thermodynamics is consistent with a\nmotion that is time-irreversible at a microscopic level. From this change of\nparadigm it becomes easy to derive a $H-theorem$. A comparison with the\ntraditional Boltzmann approach is presented. We also show how our approach can\nbe implemented in order to describe reversible processes. By considering a\nprocess defined simultaneously by initial and final conditions a well defined\nstochastic process is introduced and we are able to derive a Schroedinger\nequation, an example of time reversible equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2004 09:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-17"}
