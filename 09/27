A general powerful technique which can be employed for proving\ntermination of these algorithms is that of well quasi-orderings. Several\nmethodologies have been proposed for derivation of new well quasi-ordered\nconstraint systems. However, many of these constraint systems suffer from a\n\"constraint explosion problem\", as the number of the generated constraints\ngrows exponentially with the size of the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a refinement of the theory of well quasi-orderings, called the theory of\nbetter quasi-orderings, is more appropriate for symbolic model checking, since\nit allows inventing constraint systems which are both well quasi-ordered and\ncompact. As a main application, we introduce existential zones, a constraint\nsystem for verification of systems with unboundedly many clocks and use our\nmethodology to prove that existential zones are better quasi-ordered. We show\nhow to use existential zones in verification of timed Petri nets and present\nsome experimental results. Also, we apply our methodology to derive new\nconstraint systems for verification of broadcast protocols, lossy channel\nsystems, and integral relational automata.

The\nensuing concept of dynamic complexity (and related intrinsic chaoticity) is\nabsolutely universal and can be applied to the problem of (natural and\nartificial) intelligence and consciousness that dynamically emerge now as a\nhigh enough, properly specified levels of unreduced complexity of a suitable\ninteraction process. Emergent consciousness can be identified with the\nappearance of bound, permanently localised states in the multivalued brain\ndynamics from strongly chaotic states of unconscious intelligence, by analogy\nwith classical behaviour emergence from quantum states at the lowest levels of\ncomplex world dynamics. We show that the main properties of this dynamically\nemerging consciousness (and intelligence, at the preceding complexity level)\ncorrespond to empirically derived properties of natural consciousness and\nobtain causally substantiated conclusions about their artificial realisation,\nincluding the fundamentally justified paradigm of genuine machine\nconsciousness. This rigorously defined machine consciousness is different from\nboth natural consciousness and any mechanistic, dynamically single-valued\nimitation of the latter. We use then the same, truly universal concept of\ncomplexity to derive equally rigorous conclusions about mental and social\nimplications of this complex-dynamic consciousness concept, demonstrating its\ncritical importance for further progress of science and civilisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2004 10:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

The latter shows a characteristic transitory behavior when\ntraced over different values of the geometric threshold $t$ which defines\nprotein residues in contact. To account for this observation, we propose a\nnon-linear mechanical model-- formulated as a Hamiltonian system in which $t$\nis regarded as a continuous parameter-- that allows to identify the behavior of\nthe Shannon entropy as a first-order phase transition between a disordered and\nan ordered phase of the proposed mechanical system. The transition itself\nreflects the formation of protein structure when represented in terms of\ncontact graph cycles, and it is identified as an example of a fragmentation\ntransition known from several other statistical systems without a proper\nthermodynamic limit. Some interesting implications follow from our model\nincluding chirality, broken $t$-symmetry and one-dimensionality. Although\ndefined from purely structural considerations, we further show that for native\nprotein structures these observables follow some of the quantitative rules that\nare typically valid for amino acid types in protein sequences.
