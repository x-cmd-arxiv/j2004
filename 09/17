The position of the inner radius of a thin disk around a\nneutron star can be estimated by comparing the electromagnetic energy density\ngenerated by the neutron star with the kinetic energy density of the disk.\nInside the light cylinder, the near zone electromagnetic field is essentially\nthe dipole magnetic field, and the inner radius is the conventional Alfven\nradius. Far outside the light cylinder, in the radiation zone, $E=B$ and the\nelectromagnetic energy density is $<S >/c \\propto 1/r^2$ where $S$ is the\nPoynting vector. Shvartsman (1970) argued that a stable equilibrium can not be\nfound in the radiative zone because the electromagnetic energy density\ndominates over the kinetic energy density, with the relative strength of the\nelectromagnetic stresses increasing with radius. In order to check whether this\nis true also near the light cylinder, we employ global electromagnetic field\nsolutions for rotating oblique magnetic dipoles (Deutsch 1955). Near the light\ncylinder the electromagnetic energy density increases steeply enough with\ndecreasing $r$ to balance the kinetic energy density at a stable equilibrium.\nThe transition from the near zone to the radiation zone is broad.

In this basis, then, cubic string field theory\npossesses a well-defined initial value formulation and a conserved Hamiltonian.\nWith this new understanding it seems natural to study time dependent solutions\nrepresenting the the decay of an unstable D-branes. In this paper we study such\nsolutions using level truncation of mode oscillators in the lightcone basis,\nfinding both homogenous solutions by perturbatively expanding the string field\nin modes $e^{nt}$, and inhomogenous solutions by integrating the equations of\nmotion on a lattice. Truncating the theory to level $(\\tilde{2},\\tilde{4})$ in\n$\\alpha^+$ oscillators, we find time dependent solutions whose behavior seems\nto converge to that of earlier solutions constructed in the center of mass\nbasis, where the cubic action contains an infinite number of time derivatives.\nWe further construct time-dependent inhomogeneous solutions including all\nfields up to level $(\\tilde{2},\\tilde{4})$. These solutions at the outset\ndisplay rather erratic behavior due to an unphysical instability introduced by\ntruncating the theory at the linear level. However upon truncating away the\nfield responsible for the instability, we find more reasonable solutions which\nmay possibly represent an approximation to tachyon matter.

This generalizes earlier work on\ndiscretization of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on tangent bundles and\ncotangent bundles respectively. In particular we show how to obtain a large\nclass of discrete algorithms using this geometric approach. We give new\ngeometric insight into the Newmark model for example and we give a direct\ndiscrete formulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi method. Moreover we extend these\nideas to deriving a discrete version of the maximum principle for smooth\noptimal control problems. We define discrete variational principles that are\nthe discrete counterpart of known variational principles. For dynamical\nsystems, we introduce principles of critical action on both the tangent bundle\nand the cotangent bundle. These two principles are equivalent and allow one to\nrecover most of the classical symplectic algorithms. We also identify a class\nof coordinate transformations that leave the variational principles presented\nin this paper invariant and develop a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi theory. This\ntheory allows us to show that the energy error in the (symplectic) integration\nof a dynamical system is invariant under discrete canonical transformations.\nFinally, for optimal control problems we develop a discrete maximum principle\nthat yields discrete necessary conditions for optimality. These conditions are\nin agreement with the usual conditions obtained from Pontryagin maximum\nprinciple.
