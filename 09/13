Both data sets show a rise in the ratio of the nebular\nsurface brightness to stellar flux (S/F_*) of approximately two orders of\nmagnitude towards the blue end of the far-UV bandpass. Scattering models using\nsimple dust geometries fail to reproduce the observed S/F_* for realistic grain\nproperties. The high spectral resolution of the FUSE data reveals a rich\nfluorescent molecular hydrogen spectrum ~1000\" north of the star that is\nclearly distinguished from the steady blue continuum. The S/F_* remains roughly\nconstant at all nebular pointings, showing that fluorescent molecular hydrogen\nis not the dominant cause for the blue rise. We discuss three possible\nmechanisms for the ``Blue Dust'': differential extinction of the dominant star\n(HD 34078), unusual dust grain properties, and emission from nebular dust. We\nconclude that uncertainties in the nebular geometry and the degree of dust\nclumping are most likely responsible for the blue rise.

If IC 405 was observed with a spatial resolution of\nless than 0.4 pc, for example, an observer would infer a far-UV flux that was\n2.5 times the true value, giving the appearance of a stellar continuum that was\nless extinguished than radiation from the surrounding nebula, an effect that is\nreminiscent of the observed ultraviolet properties of starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2004 15:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

A Radon plane is a normed plane obtained by using a Radon curve as\n(the boundary of) the unit ball. Many known results in Euclidean geometry also\nhold for Radon planes, for example the triangle and parallelogram area\nformulas, certain theorems on angular bisectors, the area formula of a polygon\ncircumscribed about a circle, certain isoperimetric inequalities, and the\nnon-expansive property of certain non-linear projections.\n  These results may be further generalized to arbitrary normed planes if we\nformally change the statement of the result by referring in some places to the\nantinorm instead of the norm. The antinorm is a norm dual to the norm of an\narbitrarily given normed plane, although it lives in the same plane as the\noriginal norm.\n  It is the purpose of this mainly expository paper to give a list of results\non antinorms that generalize results true for Radon norms, and in many cases\ncharacterize Radon norms among all norms in the plane.

The problem is studied in\nthree dimensions and no restrictions on the geometry are imposed. In the\ngeneric case, for an arbitrary orientation of the rotation axis, there are two\nregions of instability with different characteristics. The analysis of the\nquantum-mechanical problem is made simple due to a direct connection between\nthe classical mode vectors and the quantum-mechanical wave functions. This\nconnection is obtained via the matrix Riccati equation that governs the time\nevolution of squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. It is also shown that\nthe inclusion of gravity leads to a resonant behavior -- the particles are\nexpelled from the trap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2004 11:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
