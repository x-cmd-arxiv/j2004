We propose replacing the\ninterferometers' baseline arm-cavity light beams, which have Gaussian-shaped\nintensity profiles, by beams with mesa-shaped profiles that are flat in their\ncentral ~7 cm of radius, and that then fall toward zero as quickly as is\nallowed by diffraction in LIGO's 4 km arms.

As a consequence, the polarization states of\ngravitons also change. This effect of the L-term has been confirmed by recent\ncalculations in a curved background, which is the only proper setting, since\nsolutions of the classical Einstein equations in the presence of a L-term\nrepresent a space with constant curvature. A real value for the mass (when L<0)\nwill show up as a slight exponential damping in the gravitational potential,\nwhich is however strongly constrained by astronomical data. The consequences of\nan imaginary mass (for L>0) are still unclear; on general grounds, one can\nexpect the onset of instabilities in this case. This is also confirmed by\nnumerical simulations of quantum gravity which became recently available. These\nproperties gain a special interest in consideration of the following. (1) The\nmost recent cosmological data indicate that L is positive and of the order of\n0.1 J/m^3. Is this value compatible with a stable propagation of gravitons? (2)\nThe answer to the previous question lies perhaps in the scale dependence of the\neffective value of L. L may be negative at the small distance/large energy\nscale at which the quantum behavior of gravitational fields and waves becomes\nrelevant. Furthermore, local contributions to the vacuum energy density (in\nsuperconductors in certain states, and in very strong static electromagnetic\nfields) can change locally the sign of L, and so affect locally the propagation\nand the properties of gravitons.

More\nprecisely it is our purpose to show that property (c) of Cabello's proof,\nstating that ``local observables can be measured by means of tests on\nindividual qubits\" is definitely false since it has been obtained by a wrong\nuse of the basic rules of the quantum formalism, while property (b), stating\nthat ``distant local setups do not need to be aligned since the require perfect\ncorrelations are achieved for any local rotation of the setups\", is also wrong\ndue to the failure of validity of property (c).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 2004 12:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
