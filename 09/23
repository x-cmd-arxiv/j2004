We compare the mass function of BHs in the local\nuniverse with that expected from AGN relics, which are BHs grown entirely with\nmass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is\nestimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge\nluminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity\nfunctions. The density of BHs in the local universe is 4.6 (-1.4;+1.9) 10^5\nMsun Mpc-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the\nonly assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion onto massive BHs and that\nmerging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z=0 is generated\nmainly at z<3. Moreover, the BH growth is anti-hierarchical in the sense that\nsmaller BHs (MBH<10^7 Msun) grow at lower redshifts (z<1) with respect to more\nmassive ones (z~1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics\nis perfectly consistent with the local BHMF indicating the local BHs were\nmainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying,\nat the same time, the constraints imposed by the X-ray background. The\ncomparison with the local BHMF also suggests that the merging process is not\nimportant in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z<3). Our\nanalysis thus suggests the following scenario: local BHs grew during AGN phases\nin which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies\neff=0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda=0.1-1.7 of the Eddington\nluminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~4.5\n10^8 yr for MBH<10^7 Msun to ~1.5 10^8 yr for MBH>10^9 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 16:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Subtraction of a 2D beta\nmodel fit to the main cluster emission reveals a large scale, irregular\nresidual structure in the direction of the extension, containing both diffuse\nemission from the intra cluster medium, and extended emission from the second\nand third-brightest cluster galaxies (BG2 and BG3).

Flat-topped light beams (mesa beams) are\nbeing considered as an alternative because they average over the thermoelastic\nfluctuations much more effectively. However, the proposed mesa beams are\nsupported by nearly flat mirrors, which experience a very serious tilt\ninstability.

The tilt instability is analyzed for these\nmirrors in a companion paper by Savov and Vyatchanin. We also propose a\none-parameter family of light beams and mirrors in which, as the parameter\nalpha varies continuously from 0 to pi, the beams and supporting mirrors get\ndeformed continuously from the nearly flat-mirrored mesa configuration (\"FM\")\nat alpha=0, to the nearly concentric-mirrored mesa configuration (\"CM\") at\nalpha=pi.

His posting contains many\nstatements that are beyond the borders of acceptable scientific disputes, with\nthe scope to defame colleagues by manifestly false or misleading statements. In\nthis comment we reject the three ``critiques'' expressed by Raynal. 1. The fact\nthat we possibly misquoted our references. 2. The role of the Pauli principle\nin these kind of calculations. 3. The nature and limits of our coupled-channel\npotential model. Raynal's postings unfairly detract from the importance of our\nwork, which we published in Nuclear Physics A728, 65 (2003), on a new approach,\nMulti-Channel-Algebraic-Scattering (MCAS), for coupled-channel calculations.\nWith the MCAS approach we were able to identify systematically all low-energy\ncompound resonances, and to include effectively the Pauli principle in\ncollective, geometrical-type, macroscopic models of multichannel interaction.\nThis represents a clear advantage with respect to the current distribution of\nthe ECIS formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2004 13:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Non-uniformities were observed on a length scale\ncomparable to the diamond crystallites size. In some regions of the sensor, the\ncharge drift appears to have a component parallel to the sensor surface (i.e.,\nnormal to the applied electric field) resulting in systematic residuals between\nthe track position and the hits position as large as 40 $\\mu$m. A numerical\nsimulation of the charge drift in polycrystalline diamond was developed to\ncompute the signal induced on the electrodes by the electrons and holes\nreleased by the passing particles. The simulation takes into account the\ncrystallite structure, non-uniform trapping across the sensor, diffusion and\npolarization effects. It is in qualitative agreement with the data. Additional\nlateral electric field components result from the non-uniform trapping of\ncharges in the bulk.
