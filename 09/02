We derive the scaling relations\nbetween the radio luminosity L_r, the synchrotron X-ray luminosity L_x, the\nmass M, and the accretion rate of an accreting black hole. We argue that the\ninclusion of synchrotron losses into the scaling relations is required by the\ndata used in Merloni, Heinz, & DiMatteo (2003) to define the \"fundamental\nplane'' correlation between L_r, L_x, and M in AGNs and Galactic X-ray\nbinaries. We then fit the new scaling relations to the \"fundamental plane\"\ncorrelation. This allows us to derive statistical constraints on the\ncontribution from jet synchrotron emission to the X-rays from black holes, or,\nalternatively, on the particle acceleration scheme at work in these jets. We\nfind that, in order for jet synchrotron X-rays to be consistent with the\nobserved \"fundamental plane\" correlation, the global particle spectrum must be\nboth steep: f(gamma) ~ gamma^(-(3.4 (+0.6-0.5)), and unbroken down to energies\nwell below the radio synchrotron regime. Such a steep particle distribution\nwould imply steeper X-ray spectra than observed in most sources contributing to\nthe correlation with avalailable X-ray spectral index measurements.

However, a large fraction of captures will not be individually\nresolvable--either because they are too distant, have unfavorable orientation,\nor have too many years to go before final plunge--and so will constitute a\nsource of ``confusion noise,'' obscuring other types of sources. Here we\nestimate the shape and overall magnitude of the spectrum of confusion noise\nfrom CO captures. The overall magnitude depends on the capture rates, which are\nrather uncertain, so we present results for a plausible range of rates.

An exact\ncalculation in F allows us to apply the SW map, reducing the maximal abelian\npoint of view to a minimal nonabelian point of view (replacing 1/F with [X,X]\nat large F), resulting in matrix model equations of motion. We first study\nderivative corrections to the abelian BI action and compute the 2-loop beta\nfunction for an open string in a WZW (parallelizable) background. This beta\nfunction is the first step in the process of computing string equations of\nmotion, which can be later obtained by computing the Weyl anomaly coefficients\nor the partition function.

We provide a model for the polar localization of\nMinD based only on diffusion, a delay for nucleotide exchange, and different\nrates of attachment to the bare membrane and the occupied membrane. We derive\nanalytically the probability density, and correspondingly the length scale, for\nMinD attachment zones. Our simple analytical model illustrates the processes\ngiving rise to the observed localization of cellular MinD zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2004 21:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We show that, by contrast, there\nare two-qubit mixed states for which the REE for some range of a fixed\nnegativity is higher than that for pure states. Moreover, we demonstrate that a\nmixture of a pure entangled state and pure separable state orthogonal to it is\nlikely to give the maximal REE. By noting that the negativity is a measure of\nentanglement cost under operations preserving positivity of partial transpose,\nour results provide an explicit example of operations such that, even though\nthe entanglement cost for an exact preparation is the same, the entanglement of\ndistillation of a mixed state can exceed that of pure states. This means that\nthe entanglement manipulation via a pure state can result in a larger\nentanglement loss than that via a mixed state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2004 18:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 20:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2008 20:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-05"}

Critical values of the order\nparameters for this transition are determined by Heisenberg's indeterminacy\nrelations, change continuously, and are in excellent agreement with the recent\nand remarkable experiments with Bose condensation. It is also shown that such a\nphase transition can sucessfully model self-collapse (self-decoherence), as an\neffective classical phenomenon, on the measurement device. This then induces a\nrelative collapse (relative decoherence) as an effective quantum phenomenon on\nthe measured quantum object by measurement.\n  We demonstrate this (including the case of Bose-Einstein condensation) in the\nwell-known cases of the Stern-Gerlach spin measurement, Bell's inequality and\nthe recently discussed quantum superposition on a mirror a la Marshall et al.\nThese results provide for a proof that quantum mechanics, in distinction to all\nabsolute collapse and hidden-variable theories, is local and objective. There\nnow appear no insuperable obstacles to solving the open problems in quantum\ntheory of measurement and foundation of quantum mechanics, and strictly within\nthe standard quantum-mechanical formalism. Simply put, quantum mechanics is a\nfield theory over the Hilbert space, the classical mechanics characteristics of\nwhich emerge through spontaneous superposition breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2004 20:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
