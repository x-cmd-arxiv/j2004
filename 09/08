We first describe how any SAT\nformula can be associated with a novel family of Markov random fields (MRFs),\nparameterized by a real number \\rho \\in [0,1]. We then show that applying\nbelief propagation--a well-known ``message-passing'' technique for estimating\nmarginal probabilities--to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of\nalgorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (\\rho = 1) to\nstandard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at\nthe other extreme (\\rho = 0). Configurations in these MRFs have a natural\ninterpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order\ncan be defined. We isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering,\nwhich are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with\npositive probability in the MRF for \\rho=1. Our experimental results for k=3\nsuggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial\ncores. This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial\nassignments for \\rho<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very\nclose to being cores.

This is the miracle of the PCAC\nhypothesis which dictates a specific conspiracy between the heavy fluctuations,\nso that all together they mock the pion pole. Indeed, the observed Q^2\ndependence of the axial form factor is controlled by the effective mass m_A\n\\sim 1 GeV, rather than the pion mass. On the contrary, the onset of nuclear\nshadowing is governed by the small pion mass, rather than by the large axial\nmass scale.

As a result, neutrino\ninteractions are shadowed at very low energies of few hundred MeV, while energy\nof about 10 GeV is needed to access nuclear shadowing for the vector current.\nOn the contrary to naive expectations, nuclear absorption enhances, rather than\nsuppresses the cross section of coherent neutrino-production of pions which is\nthe strongest channel (half of the total cross section) in the black disc\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2004 18:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

How, then, can such theories be\ntested? It has been variously asserted that in a future measurement we should\nobserve the a priori most probable set of predicted properties (the\n``bottom-up'' approach), or the most probable set compatible with all current\nobservations (the ``top-down'' approach), or the most probable set consistent\nwith the existence of observers (the ``anthropic'' approach). These inhabit a\nspectrum of levels of conditionalization and can lead to qualitatively\ndifferent predictions. For example, in a context in which the densities of\nvarious species of dark matter vary among members of an ensemble of otherwise\nsimilar regions, from the top-down or anthropic viewpoints -- but not the\nbottom-up -- it would be natural for us to observe multiple types of dark\nmatter with similar contributions to the observed dark matter density. In the\nanthropic approach it is also possible in principle to strengthen this argument\nand the limit the number of likely dark matter sub-components. In both cases\nthe argument may be extendible to dark energy or primordial density\nperturbations.
