The cross section for\nde-exciting the 21-cm trasition in collisions with free electrons is more than\n10 times larger than it is in collisions with other atoms. If the fraction of\nfree electrons in the diffuse cosmic gas is between 10 and 30 per cent then\ncollisions alone can decouple the spin temperature from the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), even in moderately under-dense regions at z >15. This\ndecoupling is especially important during the very early stages of\nre-ionization when a Ly-alpha continuum background had yet to be established.\nAs a detailed example, we develop a semi-analytic model to quantify 21-cm\nemission signatures from a diffuse gas which is partially ionized at z>10 by an\nX-ray background. We find 21-cm differential brightness temperature\nfluctuations with a mean of ~8 mK and a rms value as large as 5 mK, for a\nfrequency resolution bandwidth of 100 KHz and a beamsize of 3 arcmin. Another\nexample where free electron-atom collisions are important is during the\nrecombination of bubbles ionized by short-lived UV sources. When the ionized\nfraction in these bubbles drops to 10-20 per cent their differential\ntemperature can be as high as 10 mK. We also consider the correlation of the\n21-cm temperature as a function of frequency. By isotropy, a comparison with\nthe angular projected correlation in the plane of the sky should yield an\nestimate for the matter density parameter, Omega_m, and the dark energy\ncomponent.

In particular, it can be used to\nintroduce thermodynamical fluctuations in non-variational formulations of the\nphase-field model, which permit to reach better computational efficiency and\nprovide more flexibility for describing some features of specific physical\nsituations.

Once correctly and\nexplicitly phrased, the principles of SRT allow for a wide range of `theories'\nthat differ from the standard SRT only for the difference in the chosen\nsynchronization procedures, but are wholly equivalent to SRT in predicting\nempirical facts. This results in the introduction, in the full background of\nSRT, of a suitable synchronization gauge. A complete hierarchy of\nsynchronization gauges is introduced and elucidated, ranging from the useful\nSelleri synchronization gauge (which should lead, according to Selleri, to a\nmultiplicity of theories alternative to SRT) to the more general Mansouri-Sexl\nsynchronization gauge and, finally, to the even more general\nAnderson-Vetharaniam-Stedman's synchronization gauge. It is showed that all\nthese gauges do not challenge the SRT, as claimed by Selleri, but simply lead\nto a number of formalisms which leave the geometrical structure of Minkowski\nspacetime unchanged. Several aspects of fundamental and applied interest\nrelated to the conventional aspect of the synchronization choice are discussed,\nencompassing the issue of the one-way velocity of light on inertial and\nrotating reference frames, the GPS's working, and the recasting of Maxwell\nequations in generic synchronizations. Finally, it is showed how the gauge\nfreedom introduced in SRT can be exploited in order to give a clear explanation\nof the Sagnac effect for counter-propagating matter beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 2004 10:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2004 12:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The large dimension limit for\nrotation-invariant variables in atoms is given as an example of a classical\nlimit other than hbar vanishing. Part I concerns the baryon in Rajeev's\nreformulation of 2d QCD in the large-N limit: a non-linear classical theory of\ncolor-singlet quark bilinears. 't Hooft's meson equation is the linearization\naround the vacuum on the curved grassmannian phase space. The baryon is a\ntopological soliton. Its form factor is found variationally on a succession of\nincreasing rank submanifolds of the phase space. These reduced systems are\ninteracting parton models: a derivation of parton model from the soliton\npicture. A rank-1 ansatz leads to a Hartree approximation: a relativistic 2d\nrealization of Witten's proposal. The baryon form factor is used to model x_B\ndependence of deep inelastic structure functions. In Part II, euclidean large-N\nmulti-matrix models are reformulated as classical systems for U(N) invariants.\nThe configuration space of gluon correlations is a space of non-commutative\nprobability distributions. Classical equations of motion (factorized loop\nequations) contain an anomaly that leads to a cohomological obstruction to\nfinding an action principle. This is circumvented by expressing the\nconfiguration space as a coset space of the automorphism group of the tensor\nalgebra. The action principle is interpreted as the Legendre transform of the\nentropy of operator-valued random variables. The free energy and correlations\nin the large-N limit are found variationally. The simplest variational ansatz\nis an analogue of mean-field theory and compares well with exact and numerical\nsolutions of 1 and 2 matrix models away from phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2004 19:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
