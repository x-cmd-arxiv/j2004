We here investigate a kinetic model of cooperative\ndynamics within the landscape paradigm for the dynamic heat capacity behavior.\nIn this picture, the beta-process is modeled as a thermally activated event in\na two-level system and the alpha-process is described as a beta-relaxation\nmediated cooperative transition in a double well. The model provides a\ndescription of the activated hopping in the energy landscape in close relation\nwith the cooperative nature of the hopping event. For suitable choice of\nparameters, the model predicts a frequency dependent heat capacity that\nreflects the two-step relaxation behavior.
