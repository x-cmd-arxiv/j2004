The differential phase is strongly affected by\ninstrumental and atmospheric dispersion effects. Difficulties in calibrating\nthese effects might prevent the application of the differential phase method to\nsystems with a very high contrast, such as extrasolar planets.

Therefore the geometry of the system can be determined by measuring\nthe nulls in the closure phase, and braking the remaining ambiguity due to the\nunknown system orientation by means of observations at different hour angles.\nBased on the known geometry, the planet spectrum can then be directly\nsynthesized from the closure phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2004 17:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2004 07:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The accretion of\ngas onto galaxies provides fuel for star formation, while galactic winds\ntransform the nearby IGM in a number of ways. One exciting technique to study\nthis gas is through the imaging of hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission. We use\ncosmological simulations to study the Lyman-alpha signals expected from the\ngrowth of cosmic structure from z=0-5.

However, galaxies are\nalso surrounded by \"Lyman-alpha coronae\" of diffuse IGM gas. These coronae are\ncomposed of a combination of accreting gas and material ejected from the\ncentral galaxy by winds. The Lyman-alpha emission from this phase is powered by\na combination of gravitational processes and the photoionizing background.\nWhile the former dominates at z~0, collisional excitation following\nphoto-heating may well dominate the total emission at higher redshifts. The\ncentral regions of these systems are dense enough to shield themselves from the\nmetagalactic ionizing background; unfortunately, in this regime our simulations\nare no longer reliable.

The gas ring is located at approximately\none-third of the total HI radius and one-half the optically-defined Holmberg\nradius, and contains 30% of the total HI of the galaxy. The ring surrounds a\ncentral depression in the HI distribution, so it may be a shell formed by a\nstarburst episode. However, the UBV colors in the HI hole are not bluer than\nthe rest of the galaxy as would be expected if an unusual star-forming event\nhad taken place there recently, but there is an old (~1-3 Gyr), red cluster\nnear the center of the hole that is massive enough to have produced the hole in\nthe HI. An age estimate for the ring, however, is uncertain because it is not\nobserved to be expanding. An expansion model produces a lower estimate of 0.5\nGyr, but the presence of faint star formation regions associated with the ring\nindicate a much younger age. We also estimate that the ring could have\ndispersed by now if it is older than 0.5 Gyr. This implies that the ring is\nyounger than 0.5 Gyr. A younger age would indicate that the red cluster did not\nproduce the hole and ring. If this ring and the depression in the gas which it\nsurrounds were not formed by stellar winds and supernovae, this would indicate\nthat some other, currently unidentified, mechanism is operating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2004 22:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the Seyfert 2 galaxies, the presence of\nblueshifts and redshifts on either side of the nucleus indicates that rotation\nalone cannot explain the observed radial velocities, and that radial outflow\nplays an important role. Each of the Seyfert galaxies in this sample (with the\nexception of Mrk 3) shows a bright, compact (FWHM < 0.5\") [O III] knot at the\nposition of its optical nucleus. These nuclear emission-line knots have\nradial-velocity centroids near zero, but they typically have the highest\nvelocity dispersions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2004 11:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The drift is a blue-shift, uniformly changing with rate a_t =\n(2.92 +/- 0.44) x 10^(-18) s/s^2.

Although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect,\nnone has been found. As a result, the nature of this anomaly has become of\ngrowing interest.

Our conclusion is: (1) While all the new physics models can enhance the\nrates by several orders relative to the SM predictions, the TC2 model predicts\nmuch larger rates than other models; (2) The optimal channel for probing the\ntop quark FCNC is the top-charm associated production in \\gamma-\\gamma\ncollision, which occurs at a much higher rate than e^+ e^- or e^- \\gamma\ncollision and can reach the detectable level for a large part of the parameter\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2004 12:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2004 14:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

First we argue that the local electroweak\ngauge symmetry is implied by the initial SO(4) symmetry of the scalar field.\nThen we parameterize the vacuum, in a slightly different way with respect to\nthe conventional assignment in the electroweak model, around the ground state\nmainly in two different ways: Once over the local electroweak gauge\ntransformations and once over the local $\\gamma$ basis which generates the\nSO(4) symmetry of the scalar field. Through comparing the two, we conclude that\na consistent parametrization, requires the complexification of the scalar\nfield, which simultaneously requires spacetime to obey local Lorentz invariance\nin the broken phase of the electroweak vacuum. After spontaneous symmetry\nbreakdown and complexification, the SO(3,1) invariant quantity of the scalar\nfield is identified to be the Higgs mass, which yields $m_H=v/2 \\cong 123$ GeV.\nAlso the vacuum state is normalized to a unit state by rescaling the local\n$\\gamma$ basis, so that the metric tensor inherently contains the speed of\nlight in the Higgs vacuum. We shortly consider the validity of the SO(3,1)\ninvariance property of the vacuum state in terms of the Goldstone modes, in\ncase the Higgs field departs from the ground state.

The dielectric medium is\nassumed to be periodic, with a cubic nonlinearity, and with its linear\nbackground possessing inversion symmetric dispersion relations. The medium is\nexcited by a current $\\mathbf{J}$ producing an EM wave. The wave nonlinear\nevolution is analyzed based on the modal decomposition and an expansion of the\nexact solution to the NLM into an asymptotic series with respect to some three\nsmall parameters $\\alpha $, $\\beta $ and $\\varrho $. These parameters are\nintroduced through the excitation current $\\mathbf{J}$ to scale respectively\n(i) its amplitude and consequently the magnitude of the nonlinearity; (ii) the\nrange of wavevectors involved in its modal composition, with $\\beta ^{-1}$\nscaling its spatial extension; (iii) its frequency bandwidth, with $\\varrho\n^{-1}$ scaling its time extension. We develop a consistent theory of\napproximations of increasing accuracy for the NLM with its first term governed\nby the NLS.

Consideration is given to beams of electrons,\nprotons, muons, and their antiparticles, as well as to neutral-hydrogen,\npositronium, and electron-positron-plasmoid beams. The first part is a\nsystematic overview of the theory pertaining to propagation, plasma\nself-generation, energy/current-losses, and stability of such pulses. The\nsecond part reviews the major full-scale propagation experiments which have\nbeen carried out, in atmospheric and outer-space plasmas, to assess the\nvalidity of theoretical models. It is found that the data available on these\nexperiments demonstrate that range and stability are in agreement with theory.\nIn particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current charged-particle\nbeams in the atmosphere is possible over distances equal to several Nordsieck\nlengths. In order not to be deflected by Earth's magnetic field, electron-beam\npulses need to be guided by a pre-formed channel, while proton-beam pulses may\nunder suitable conditions propagate undeflected through both the low- and\nhigh-atmosphere. In ionospheric or outer-space plasmas, very-long-range\npropagation across Earth's magnetic field requires GeV to TeV electrons or\npositron beams in order for the transverse deflection to be acceptable, while\nundeflected propagation is possible for plasmoid beams consisting of co-moving\nhigh-energy particle pairs such as electrons and positrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2004 21:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2004 23:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2009 11:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-11"}
