We start by introducing some of the basic properties of compact radio\ncores and how they scale with accretion power. The relative contribution of\njets and radio cores to the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is strongest in\nsub-Eddington black holes but also present in the most luminous objects. Radio\nand X-rays are correlated as a function of black hole mass such that the most\nmassive black holes are most suited for radio detections. We present a radio\ncore luminosity function for the present universe down to the least luminous\nAGN. The SKA will essentially detect all dormant black holes in the local\nuniverse, such as that in our Milky Way, out to several tens of Megaparsecs. It\nwill also be able to see black holes in the making at redshifts z>10 for black\nhole masses larger than 10^7 M_sun.

Since\ntheir intrinsic size and peak frequency are related and angular size and\nfrequency scale differently with redshift, there is a unique region in\nparameter space that should be occupied by emerging black holes in the epoch of\nreionization.

Here we propose a novel method of data analysis that, based on\nthe space-time combined generalization of the correlation integral leads to a\nself-consistent visualization and analysis of both spatial and temporal\ncorrelations. When analyzing global seismicity we discovered a universal\nrelation linking the spatial Influence Length of a given earthquake to the time\nelapsed from the event itself. Following an event, time correlations (i.e.\ncausality effects) exist in a region that shrinks over time, suggesting a\nlong-range dissipating stress transfer. A different process is acting in the\nshort-range where events are randomly set, evidencing a sub-diffusive growth of\nthe seismogenic zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2004 14:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We discuss in detail the analysis and show that the estimated equation\ncan describe the statistics of the turbulent cascade. A remarkably result is\nthat the main differences between longitudinal and transverse increments can be\nexplained by a simple rescaling-symmetry, namely the cascade speed of the\ntransverse increments is 1.5 times faster than that of the longitudinal\nincrements. Small differences can be found in the skewness and in a higher\norder intermittency term. The rescaling symmetry is compatible with the\nKolmogorov constants and the Karman equation and give new insight into the use\nof extended self similarity (ESS) for transverse increments. Based on the\nresults we propose an extended self similarity for the transverse increments\n(ESST).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2004 12:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
