For a near-to-limit instanton (a Coleman-de Luccia\ninstanton close to some Hawking-Moss instanton) we find approximate formulas\nfor the Euclidean action by expanding the scalar field and the metric of the\ninstanton in the powers of the scalar field amplitude. The order of the\nmagnitude of the correction to the Hawking-Moss action depends on the order of\nthe instanton (the number of crossings of the barrier by the scalar field): for\ninstantons of odd and even orders the correction is of the fourth and third\norder in the scalar field amplitude, respectively. If a near-to-limit instanton\nof the first order exists in a potential with the curvature at the top of the\nbarrier greater than 4 $\\times$ (Hubble constant)$^2$, which is the case if the\nfourth derivative of the potential at the top of the barrier is greater than\nsome negative limit value, the action of the instanton is less than the\nHawking-Moss action and, consequently, the instanton determines the outcome of\nthe vacuum decay if no other Coleman-de Luccia instanton is admitted by the\npotential. A numerical study shows that for the quartic potential the physical\nmode of the vacuum decay is given by the Coleman-de Luccia instanton of the\nfirst order also in the region of parameters in which the potential admits two\ninstantons of the second order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2004 21:53:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2004 07:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2005 21:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We prove the universal correspondence between eigenvalues of Gaudin\nHamiltonians and the so-called G-opers without monodromy in general gl(n) case\nmodulo a hypothesys on the analytic properties of the solution of a KZ-type\nequation.\n  Firstly we explore the quantum analog of the characteristic polynomial which\nis a differential operator in a variable $u$ with the coefficients in\nU(gl(n))^{\\otimes N}.

Our numerical results, using the\nMorris-Lecar neuron model with chemical synapses explicity considered, show\nthat intermediate noise levels enhance the response of the third neuron at\nfrequencies close to f0, as in the cases previously described of ghost\nresonance. For the case of inharmonic combinations of inputs (both frequencies\nshifted by the same amount Df) noise is also seen to enhance the response of\nthe third neuron at a frequency fr with also shift linearly with Df. In\naddition, we show that similar resonances can be observed as a function of the\nsynaptic time constant.
