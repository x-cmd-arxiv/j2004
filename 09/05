We show new evidence,\nbased on the combined statistics of Lyman alpha and beta absorption in quasar\nspectra, that the IGM contains a significant amount of neutral hydrogen, and is\nexperiencing rapid ionization around redshift z=6. However, we argue that\nquasar BHs, even faint ones that are below the detection thresholds of existing\noptical surveys, are unlikely to drive the evolution of the neutral fraction\naround this epoch, because they would over-produce the present-day soft X-ray\nbackground. On the other hand, the seeds of the quasar BHs around z=6 likely\nappeared at much earlier epochs (around z=20), and produced hard ionizing\nradiation by accretion. These early BHs are promising candidates to account for\nthe high redshift ionization (around z=15) implied by the recent cosmic\nmicrowave anisotropy data from WMAP. Using a model for the growth of BHs by\naccretion and mergers in a hierarchical cosmology, we suggest that the early\ngrowth of quasars must include a super-Eddington growth phase, and that,\nalthough not yet optically identified, the FIRST radio survey may have already\ndetected several thousand BHs at z>6 with Mbh>10^8 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2004 20:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
