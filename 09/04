Vidal, Latorre, Rico and\nKitaev conjectured that von Neumann entropy of a large block of neighboring\nspins approaches a constant as the size of the block increases. We evaluated\nthis limiting entropy as a function of anisotropy and transverse magnetic\nfield. We used the methods based on integrable Fredholm operators and\nRiemann-Hilbert problem. The entropy is singular at phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2004 23:02:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 15:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Oct 2004 15:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2004 00:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
