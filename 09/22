Four of the five\nsources are quite blue compared to typical lower-redshift dropout galaxies and\nare clustered within a 1 arcmin**2 region. Because all 5 sources are near the\nlimit of the NICMOS data, we have carefully evaluated their reality.

A search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearly\nrevealed 3 of the 5 candidates and weakly detected a 4th candidate, suggesting\nthe contamination could be higher. For comparison with predictions from lower\nredshift samples we take a conservative approach and adopt four z~7-8 galaxies\nas our sample. With the same detection criteria on simulated datasets, assuming\nno-evolution from z~3.8, we predict 10 sources at z~7-8, or 14 if we use a more\nrealistic (1+z)^{-1} size scaling.

Effectively this sets an upper\nlimit on the luminosity density down to 0.3 L*. This result is consistent with\nsignificant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z~7.5\nto z~3.8. Even with the lower UV luminosity density at z~7.5, it appears that\ngalaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts,\nthough definitive measurements remain to be made.

However, the mass resolution in current simulations\nis still poor. Due to technical difficulties, it is necessary to use both\ngreatly reduced number density of particles and greatly raised unit particle\nmass. Consequently, the particle masses used in cosmological simulations are\nabout $10^{70}$ times larger than the $Gev$ candidates in particle physics.\nThis is a huge physical bias that cannot be neglected when interpreting the\nresults of the simulations. Here we discuss how such a bias affects Cold Dark\nMatter (CDM) cosmological simulations. We find that the small scale properties\nof the CDM particle system are changed in two aspects. 1) An upper limit is\nimposed on the spatial resolution of the simulation results. 2) Most\nimportantly, an unexpected short mean free path is produced, and the\ncorresponding two body scattering cross section is close to the value expected\nin the Self-Interaction Dark Matter(SIDM) model.

Our main objective has been to determine\nthe abundance ratio of N2D+ and N2H+ towards the nuclei of these cores and thus\nto obtain estimates of the degree of deuterium enrichment, a symptom of\nadvanced chemical evolution according to current models. We find that the\nN(N2D+)/N(N2H+) ratio is larger in more \"centrally concentrated cores\" with\nlarger peak H2 and N2H+ column density than the sample mean. The deuterium\nenrichment in starless cores is presently ascribed to depletion of CO in the\nhigh density (> 3*10^4 cm-3) core nucleus. To substantiate this picture, we\ncompare our results with observations in dust emission at 1.2 mm and in two\ntransitions of C18O. We find a good correlation between deuterium fractionation\nand N(C18O)/N(H2) for the nuclei of 14 starless cores. We, thus, identified a\nset of properties that characterize the most evolved, or \"pre-stellar\",\nstarless cores. These are: higher N2H+ and N2D+ column densities, higher\nN(N2D+)/N(N2H+), more pronounced CO depletion, broader N2H+ lines with infall\nasymmetry, higher central H2 column densities and a more compact density\nprofile than in the average core.

One would\nexpect, therefore, that computational approaches that incorporate this a priori\ninformation will be more effective than those that do not. The Richardson-Lucy\n(RL) algorithm, for example, can be viewed as a maximum-likelihood (ML) method\nfor image deblurring when the data noise is assumed to be Poissonian.\nLeast-squares (LS) approaches, on the other hand, arises from the assumption\nthat the noise is Gaussian with fixed variance across pixels, which is rarely\naccurate. Given this, it is surprising that in many cases results obtained\nusing LS techniques are relatively insensitive to whether the noise is\nPoissonian or Gaussian. Furthermore, in the presence of Poisson noise, results\nobtained using LS techniques are often comparable with those obtained by the RL\nalgorithm. We seek an explanation of these phenomena via an examination of the\nregularization properties of particular LS algorithms.

We finish with a convergence analysis of\nthe RL algorithm. Numerical results are presented throughout the paper. It is\nimportant to stress that the subject treated in this paper is not academic. In\nfact, in comparison with many ML algorithms, the LS algorithms are much easier\nto use and to implement, often provide faster convergence rates, and are much\nmore flexible regarding the incorporation of constraints on the solution.\nConsequently, if little to no improvement is gained in the use of an ML\napproach over an LS algorithm, the latter will often be the preferred approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 11:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

Such a process would have a strong affect on the early protogalactic\nevolution phase, the origin and evolution of galactic morphologies and link\ncentral properties of galaxies like the origin of central massive black holes\nwith their global structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 13:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

However, at a radial distance of a fraction\nof a parsec from Sgr A*, two rings populated by young massive stars suggest a\nrecent burst of star formation in a rather hostile environment. Here we explore\ntwo ways of creating such young stellar rings with a gaseous accretion disk: by\nself-gravity in a massive disk, and by capturing \"old\" low mass stars and\ngrowing them via gas accretion in a disk. The minimum disk mass is above 10^4\nMsun for the first mechanism and is few tens times larger for the second one.\nThe observed relatively small velocity dispersion of the stars rules out disks\nmore massive than around 10^5 Msun: heavier stellar or gas disks would warp\neach other by orbital precession in an axisymmetric potential too strongly. The\ncapture of \"old\" stars by a disk is thus unlikely as the origin of the young\nstellar disks. The absence of a massive nuclear gas disk in Sgr A* now implies\nthat the disk was either accreted by the SMBH, which would then imply almost a\nquasar-like luminosity for Sgr A*, or was consumed in the star formation\nepisode. The latter possibility appears to be more likely on theoretical\ngrounds. We also consider whether accretion disk plane changes, expected to\noccur due to fluctuations in the angular momentum of gas infalling into the\ncentral parsec of a galaxy, would dislodge the embedded stars from the disk\nmidplane.

According to the present\nmechanism, (groups of) pair of gap minima appear at points on the Fermi surface\nwhich are connected by the nesting vector ${\\bf Q}$, in both cases of s-wave\nsuperconductors and non s-wave ones. We briefly discuss other superconductors\nwith highly anisotropic gap function, e.g., PrOs$_{4}$Sb$_{12}$ and\nNa$_{0.33}$CoO$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2004 03:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The energy\nfunctional of a polytropic star is similar to Tsallis free energy and the\nH-function associated with a stellar polytrope is similar to Tsallis entropy.\nMore generally, the energy functional of a barotropic star is similar to a\ngeneralized free energy and the H-function associated with a spherical stellar\nsystem is similar to a generalized entropy. Their optimization under\nappropriate constraints determines a condition of nonlinear dynamical\nstability, not a condition of thermodynamical stability. The criterion of\ndynamical stability for barotropic stars described by the Euler-Poisson system\nis similar to a condition of canonical stability and the criterion of dynamical\nstability for collisionless stellar systems described by the Vlasov-Poisson\nsystem is similar to a condition of microcanonical stability. Hence, stellar\nsystems are stable whenever corresponding barotropic stars are stable but the\nconverse is wrong in general. This provides a new interpretation of Antonov\nfirst law in terms of ensemble inequivalence. In this context, Tsallis\nfunctional is not a true entropy or a true free energy. This is a useful\nH-function making the bridge between polytropic and isothermal distributions. A\nthermodynamical analogy can be developed to investigate the nonlinear dynamical\nstability problem but the notions of entropy, free energy and temperature are\nessentially effective.

Sidles and Sigg showed that\nthe strength T of this torque is 26.2 times greater for advanced LIGO's\nbaseline cavities -- nearly flat spherical mirrors which support Gaussian beams\n(``FG'' cavities), than for nearly concentric spherical mirrors which support\nGaussian beams with the same diffraction losses as the baseline case -- ``CG''\ncavities: T^{FG}/T^{CG} = 26.2. This has motivated a proposal to change the\nbaseline design to nearly concentric, spherical mirrors. In order to reduce\nthermoelastic noise in advanced LIGO, O'Shaughnessy and Thorne have proposed\nreplacing the spherical mirrors and their Gaussian beams by ``Mexican-Hat''\n(MH) shaped mirrors which support flat-topped, ``mesa'' shaped beams. In this\npaper we compute the tilt-instability torque for advanced-LIGO cavities with\nnearly flat MH mirrors and mesa beams (``FM'' cavities) and nearly concentric\nMH mirrors and mesa beams (``CM'' cavities), with the same diffraction losses\nas in the baseline FG case. We find that the relative sizes of the restoring\ntorques are T^{CM}/T^{CG} = 0.91, T^{FM}/T^{CG} = 96, T^{FM}/T^{FG} = 3.67.\nThus, the nearly concentric MH mirrors have a weaker tilt instability than any\nother configuration.

We consider the general\nsituation in which the state moves in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, a\ndrift term is present, and the operators driving the state evolution may be\nunbounded. However, considerations are restricted by the assumption that there\nexists an analytic domain, dense in the state space, on which solutions of the\ncontrolled Schrodinger equation may be expressed globally in exponential form.\nThe issue of controllability then naturally focuses on the ability to steer the\nquantum state on a finite-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere in Hilbert\nspace -- and thus on analytic controllability. A relatively straightforward\nstrategy allows the extension of Lie-algebraic conditions for strong analytic\ncontrollability derived earlier for the simpler, time-independent system in\nwhich the drift Hamiltonian and the interaction Hamiltonia have no intrinsic\ntime dependence. Enlarging the state space by one dimension corresponding to\nthe time variable, we construct an augmented control system that can be treated\nas time-independent.
