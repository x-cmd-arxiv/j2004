There is accumulating evidence that the H beta profile is dominated by\ngravity, and thus provides a useful estimate of the black hole mass in AGN. The\nshift and asymmetry commonly seen in C IV suggest that non gravitational\neffects, such as obscuration and radiation pressure, may affect the line\nprofile. We explore the relation between the H beta and C IV profiles using UV\nspectra available for 81 of the 87 z < 0.5 PG quasars in the Boroson & Green\n(BG92) sample. We find the following: (1) Narrow C IV lines (FWHM < 2000 km/s)\nare rare (~2 per cent occurrence rate) compared to narrow H beta lines (~20 per\ncent). (2) In most objects where the H beta FWHM <4000 km/s the C IV line is\nbroader than H beta, but the reverse is true when the H beta FWHM > 4000 km/s.\nThis argues against the view that C IV generally originates closer to the\ncenter, compared to H beta.\n  (3) C IV appears to provide a significantly less accurate, and possibly\nbiased estimate of the black hole mass in AGN, compared with H beta. (4) All\nobjects where C IV is strongly blueshifted and asymmetric have a high L/L_Edd,\nbut the reverse is not true. This suggests that a high L/L_Edd is a necessary\nbut not sufficient condition for generating a blueshifted asymmetric C IV\nemission. (5) We also find indications for dust reddening and scattering in\n`normal' AGN. In particular, PG quasars with a redder optical-UV continuum\nslope show weaker C IV emission, stronger C IV absorption, and a higher optical\ncontinuum polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2004 17:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are\nobtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the\nsubhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical\nfriction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these\neffects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass loss\nrate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. This\nallows us to write the average mass loss rate as a simple function that depends\nonly on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent\nhalo. After calibrating the model by matching the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nof cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the SHMF.We find\nthat, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal.\nInstead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent\nhalo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a\nhalo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus\nallowing less time for mass loss to operate. We analyze the halo-to-halo\nscatter, and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends\nmost strongly on their accretion history in the last Gyr.

We obtain for such kind of theory that the extra states\nof polarization have amplitude several orders of magnitude smaller than the\npolarizations purely general relativity (GR), h_(+) and h_(x), in the\nVIRGO-LIGO frequency band. This result appears using the best limit to the\ngraviton mass inferred from solar system observations and if we consider that\nall the components of the metric perturbation have the same amplitude h.\nHowever, if we consider low frequency gravitational waves (e.g., f_(GW) ~\n10^(-7) Hz), the extra polarization states produce similar Newman-Penrose\namplitudes that the polarization states purely GR. This particular\ncharacteristic of the bimetric theory studied here could be used, for example,\nto directly impose limits on the mass of the graviton from future experiments\nthat study the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2004 14:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

In the present paper\nwe study the behavior of the curvature operator, the curvature form and the\nfocal points of a dynamical Lagrangian distribution after its reduction by\narbitrary first integrals in involution. The interesting phenomenon is that the\ncurvature form of so-called monotone increasing Lagrangian dynamical\ndistributions, which appear naturally in mechanical systems, does not decrease\nafter reduction.
