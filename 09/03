Using\na model for the effective quark-quark interaction that has proved successful in\nthe light meson sector, we solve the scalar diquark Bethe-Salpeter equations\nand use the obtained Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes to compute the diquarks'\nelectromagnetic form factors. The scalar ud diquark charge radius is about 8%\nlarger than the pion charge radius, indicating that these diquarks are somewhat\nlarger in size than the corresponding mesons. We also provide analytic fits for\nthe form factor over a moderate range in Q^2, which may be useful, for example,\nin building quark-diquark models of nucleons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2004 20:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2004 14:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

We show that this Kuramoto\nlength is also relevant to determine whether the discreteness of molecules is\nsignificant or not.
