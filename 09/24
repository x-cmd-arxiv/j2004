Previous studies of the color-magnitude\nrelation over a range of redshifts suggest that the luminosity of an early-type\ngalaxy is an indicator of its metallicity, whereas residuals in color from the\nrelation are indicators of the luminosity-weighted age of its stars. We show\nthat this, when combined with our finding that velocity dispersion plays a\ncrucial role, has a number of interesting implications.

Similarly, galaxies with large dynamical mass\nestimates also tend to be older. In addition, at fixed luminosity, galaxies\nwhich are smaller, or have larger velocity dispersions, or are more massive,\ntend to be older. Second, models in which galaxies with the largest velocity\ndispersions are also the most metal poor are difficult to reconcile with our\ndata. However, at fixed velocity dispersion, galaxies have a range of ages and\nmetallicities: the older galaxies have smaller metallicities, and vice-versa.\nFinally, a plot of velocity dispersion versus luminosity can be used as an age\nindicator: lines of constant age run parallel to the correlation between\nvelocity dispersion and luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2004 21:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

For a simple super-Eddington model with a single porosity\nlength that is assumed to be on the order of the gravitational scale height,\nthe overall mass loss is similar to that derived in previous porosity work.\nThis is much higher than is typical of line-driven winds, but is still only a\nfew percent of the photon tiring limit--for which the luminosity becomes\ninsufficient to carry the flow out of the gravitational potential.

In particular, we start from the well known fact that\nabundance ratios depend on stellar yields, initial mass function and stellar\nlifetimes and we show, by means of specific examples, that in some cases it is\nnot correct to infer constraints on the contributions from different SN types\n(Ia, II), and particularly on different sets of yields, in the absence of a\ncomplete chemical evolution model taking into account stellar lifetimes. In\nspite of the fact that some of these results should be well known, we believe\nthat it is useful to discuss the meaning of abundance ratios in the light of\nseverel recent claims based upon an incorrect interpretation of observed\nabundance ratios. In particular, the procedure, often used in the recent\nliterature, of deriving directly conclusions about stellar nucleosynthesis,\njust by relating abundance ratios to yield ratios, implicitly assumes the\ninstantaneous recycling approximation (I.R.A.). This approximation is clearly\nnot correct when one analyzes the contributions of SNIa relative to SNII as\nfunctions of cosmic time. In this paper we show that the uncertainty which\narises from adopting this oversimplified procedure in a variety of\nastrophysical objects, such as elliptical galaxies, the intracluster medium and\nhigh redshift objects, does not allow us to draw any firm conclusion, and that\nthe differences between abundance ratios predicted by models with I.R.A. and\nmodels with detailed stellar lifetimes is of the same order as the differences\nbetween different sets of yields.

The Regge poles have various helicity-flip residues, which allows a\nchange from the longitudinal to transverse polarization. In this way a\nsignificant reduction of the longitudinal polarization fraction can be\nproduced. In the factorization approximation we find agreement with recent data\nfrom the BaBar and Belle collaborations in the B => K* phi decay channel, as a\nresult of an appropriate choice of semileptonic form factors and Regge\nexchanges. On the other hand, data for the K* rho decay channels appear more\nelusive. The soft effects discussed in the present paper are based on a model\nof Regge trajectories that is shown to reproduce correctly in the non-charmed\ncase the Regge phenomenology of light mesons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2004 14:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

The relative energy\nspectra as well as the angular distributions of the 10Be+n center of mass have\nbeen extracted for both targets. For the breakup on Pb target, the selection of\nforward scattering angles is found to be effective to extract almost purely the\nfirst-order E1 Coulomb breakup component, and to exclude the nuclear\ncontribution and higher-order Coulomb breakup components. This angle-selected\nenergy spectrum is thus used to deduce the spectroscopic factor for the\n10Be(0+) 2s_1/2 configuration in 11Be which is found to be 0.72+-0.04 with\nB(E1) up to Ex=4 MeV of 1.05+-0.06 e2fm2. The energy weighted E1 strength up to\nEx=4 MeV explains 70+-10% of the cluster sum rule, consistent with the obtained\nspectroscopic factor. The non-energy weighted sum rule is used to extract the\nroot mean square distance of the halo neutron to be 5.77(16) fm, consistent\nwith previously known values. In the breakup with C target, we have observed\nthe excitations to the known unbound states in 11Be at Ex=1.78 MeV and 3.41\nMeV.
