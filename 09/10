We here present a spectroscopic study of the\nexceptionally bright (10^6 - 10^8 Lsun) but compact (Re ~ 5 pc) nuclear star\nclusters in very late type spirals with UVES at the VLT. We find the velocity\ndispersions of the nine clusters in our sample to range from 13 to 34 km/s.\nUsing photometric data from the HST/WFPC2 and spherically symmetric dynamical\nmodels we determine masses between 8*10^5 and 6*10^7 Msun. The mass to light\nratios range from 0.2 to 1.5 in the I band. This indicates a young mean age for\nmost clusters, in agreement with previous studies. Given their high masses and\nsmall sizes we find that nuclear clusters are among the objects with the\nhighest mean surface density known (up to 10^5 Msun pc^-2). From their\ndynamical properties we infer that, rather than small bulges, the closest\nstructural kin of nuclear clusters appear to be massive compact star clusters.\nThis includes such different objects as globular clusters, \"super star\nclusters\", ultra compact dwarf galaxies and the nuclei of dwarf elliptical\ngalaxies. It is a challenge to explain why, despite the wildly different\ncurrent environments, all different types of massive star clusters share very\nsimilar and structural properties. A possible explanation links UCDs and\nmassive globular clusters to nuclear star clusters through stripping of\nnucleated dwarf galaxies in a merger event. The extreme properties of this type\nof clusters would then be a consequence of their location in the centers of\ntheir respective host galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2004 17:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the\ntime-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the\nflows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in\nthis region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole\nspin reported in Paper I of this series is explained by a strongly\nspin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically;\nwhen a/M > 0.9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux\ncarried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular\nmomentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions\nof traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no \"stress edge\", no\nsurface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the\ninner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of\nsurface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties\nsuch as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently\ndepressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly-spinning black\nholes mass growth can lead to spindown. Spinning black holes also lose energy\nby Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black\nhole spin, rising to 10% or more of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high\nspin. As the black hole spins faster, the path of the Poynting flux changes\nfrom being predominantly within the accretion disk to predominantly within the\nfunnel outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2004 18:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

These arise typically in the description of critical systems with quenched\ndisorder, but also in other contexts including dilute self-avoiding polymers\nand percolation. We show that such CFTs must in general possess, in addition to\ntheir stress energy tensor T(z), an extra field whose holomorphic part, t(z),\nhas conformal weight two. The singular part of the Operator Product Expansion\n(OPE) between T(z) and t(z) is uniquely fixed up to a single number b, defining\na new `anomaly' which is a characteristic of any c=0 CFT, and which may be used\nto distinguish between different such CFTs. The extra field t(z) is not primary\n(unless b=0), and is a so-called `logarithmic operator' except in special cases\nwhich include affine (Kac-Moody) Lie-super current algebras. The number b\ncontrols the question of whether Virasoro null-vectors arising at certain\nconformal weights contained in the c=0 Kac table may be set to zero or not, in\nthese nonunitary theories. This has, in the familiar manner, implications on\nthe existence of differential equations satisfied by conformal blocks involving\nprimary operators with Kac-table dimensions. It is shown that c=0 theories\nwhere t(z) is logarithmic, contain, besides T and t, additional fields with\nconformal weight two. If the latter are a fermionic pair, the OPEs between the\nholomorphic parts of all these conformal weight-two operators are automatically\ncovariant under a global U(1|1) supersymmetry. A full extension of the Virasoro\nalgebra by the Laurent modes of these extra conformal weight-two fields,\nincluding t(z), remains an interesting question for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2004 17:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The theory so obtained is referred to as the deformed\ntheory (to avoid the previously used term \"off-shell\"). An important by-product\nof this result is that any higher derivative correction to ordinary\nsupergravity of the same dimension as R^4, but not necessarily containing it,\nderived e.g. from M-theory, must appear in a form compatible with the equations\nobtained here. Unfortunately we have not yet much to say about the explicit\nstructure of these corrections in terms of the fields in the massless\nsupermultiplet. Our results are potentially powerful since if the dimension\nzero torsion could be derived by other means, our reformulation of the Bianchi\nidentities as a number of algebraic relations implies that the full theory\nwould be known to first order in the deformation, including the dynamics.

The evolution of the spectrum can be inferred using physical arguments\ndescribing the competition between the initial spectrum and the new frequencies\ngenerated by the dynamics.

For example, work over the\nlast decade has shown that the energy of a quantum system limits the rate at\nwhich it can perform significant computational operations, and suggests that we\nmight validly interpret energy as in fact being the speed at which a physical\nsystem is \"computing,\" in some appropriate sense of the word. In this paper, we\nexplore the precise nature of this connection. Elementary results in quantum\ntheory show that the Hamiltonian energy of any quantum system corresponds\nexactly to the angular velocity of state-vector rotation (defined in a certain\nnatural way) in Hilbert space, and also to the rate at which the state-vector's\ncomponents (in any basis) sweep out area in the complex plane. The total angle\ntraversed (or area swept out) corresponds to the action of the Hamiltonian\noperator along the trajectory, and we can also consider it to be a measure of\nthe \"amount of computational effort exerted\" by the system, or effort for\nshort. For any specific quantum or classical computational operation, we can\n(at least in principle) calculate its difficulty, defined as the minimum effort\nrequired to perform that operation on a worst-case input state, and this in\nturn determines the minimum time required for quantum systems to carry out that\noperation on worst-case input states of a given energy. As examples, we\ncalculate the difficulty of some basic 1-bit and n-bit quantum and classical\noperations in an simple unconstrained scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2004 23:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2005 04:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2005 19:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2005 01:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By explicitly introducing time into our derivation of Bell's\ntheorem, an extra term related to the time-ordering of actual measurements is\nfound to augment (i.e. weaken) the upper bound of the inequality. Since the\nsame locality assumptions hold for this rederivation as for the original, we\nconclude that only {\\em classical} measurement-order independent local hidden\nvariable theories are constrained by Bell's inequality; time dependent,\nnon-classical local theories (i.e. theories respecting Heisenberg's Uncertainty\nPrinciple) can satisfy this new bound while exceeding Bell's limit.\nUnconditional nonlocality is only expected to occur with Bell parameters\nbetween $2\\sqrt{2}$ and 4. This weakening of Bell's inequality is seen for the\nquantum Bell operator (squared) as an extra term involving the commutators of\n{\\em local} measurement operators. We note that a factorizable second-quantized\nwavefunction can reproduce experimental measurements; because such\nwavefunctions allow local de Broglie-Bohm hidden variable modelling, we have\nanother indication that violation of {\\em Bell's} inequality does not require\nan acceptance of non-locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 2004 04:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2004 18:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
