It is found that the discrete spectrum of unstable ideal MHD\n(magnetohydrodynamic) instabilities ceases to exist unless MHD is modified\n(regularized) by introducing a short-perpendicular-wavelength cutoff. Attempts\nto use ray tracing to estimate the regularized MHD spectrum fail due to the\noccurrence of chaotic ray trajectories. In quantum chaos theory, strong chaos\nin the semiclassical limit leads to eigenvalue statistics the same as those of\na suitable ensemble of random matrices. For instance, the probability\ndistribution function for the separation between neighboring eigenvalues is as\nderived from random matrix theory and goes to zero at zero separation. This\ncontrasts with the Poissonian distribution found in separable systems, showing\nthat a signature of quantum chaos is level repulsion. In order to determine\nwhether eigenvalues of the regularized MHD problem obey the same statistics as\nthose of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in both the separable 1-D case and the\nchaotic 3-D cases, we have assembled data sets of ideal MHD eigenvalues for a\nSuydam-unstable cylindrical (1-D) equilibrium using \\emph{Mathematica} and a\nMercier-unstable (3-D) equilibrium using the CAS3D code. In the 1-D case, we\nfind that the unregularized Suydam-approximation spectrum has an anomalous peak\nat zero eigenvalue separation. On the other hand, regularization by restricting\nthe domain of $\\kvec_{\\perp}$ recovers the expected Poissonian distribution. In\nthe 3-D case we find strong evidence of level repulsion within mode families,\nbut mixing mode families produces Poissonian statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2004 03:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Several microarray studies yielded\ngene sets whose expression profiles successfully predicted survival (Ramaswamy\net al 2003; Sorlie et al 2001; van't Veer et al 2003). Nevertheless, the\noverlap between these gene sets is almost zero. Such small overlaps were\nobserved also in other complex diseases (Lossos et al 2003; Miklos and Maleszka\n2004), and the variables that could account for the differences had evoked a\nwide interest. One of the main open questions in this context is whether the\ndisparity can be attributed only to trivial reasons such as different\ntechnologies, different patients and different types of analysis. Results: To\nanswer this question we concentrated on one single breast cancer dataset, and\nanalyzed it by one single method, the one which was used by van't Veer et al to\nproduce a set of outcome predictive genes. We showed that in fact the resulting\nset of genes is not unique; it is strongly influenced by the subset of patients\nused for gene selection. Many equally predictive lists could have been produced\nfrom the same analysis. Three main properties of the data explain this\nsensitivity: (a) many genes are correlated with survival; (b) the differences\nbetween these correlations are small; (c) the correlations fluctuate strongly\nwhen measured over different subsets of patients. A possible biological\nexplanation for these properties is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 2004 23:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
