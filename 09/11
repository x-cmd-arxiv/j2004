In the Riemannian setting one proof, due\nto Szab\\'o, uses spectral properties of the so-called Szab\\'o operator. In this\npaper we extend Szab\\'o's method to the pseudo-Riemannian setting, obtaining\nresults comparable to those of Wolf. Most results concerning the Szab\\'o\noperator in the pseudo-Riemannian setting are presented using methods of\nalgebraic topology. This paper exploits the polynomial nature of the Szab\\'o\noperator along with its behavior over the nullcone, both of which have received\nlittle attention this far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2004 01:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
