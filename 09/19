We found that the torques alone generated by the\nmoderately strong bar that gives the maximum of tangential-to-radial force\nratio as $(F_{Tan}/F_{Rad})_{max}= 0.3$ are not sufficient to drive the gas\nparticles close to the center due to the barrier imposed by the inner Lindblad\nresonances (ILRs). In order to transport the gas particles towards the nucleus\n($r<100$ pc), a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and high sound speed of\nthe gas are required to be present. The former is required to remove the inner\ninner Lindblad resonance (IILR) that prevents gas inflow close to the nucleus,\nwhile the latter provides favourable conditions for the gas particles to lose\ntheir angular momentum and to spiral in. Our models that have no IILR show the\ntrailing nuclear spirals whose innermost parts reach close to the center in a\ncurling way when the gas sound speed is $ c_{s} \\gtrsim 15$ km s$^{-1}$. They\nresemble the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals observed in the central\nkiloparsec of spiral galaxies.

Since this appears to be empirically the case, we may reverse the\nargument and consider field amplification as a measure of nuclear CR\nacceleration and it has indeed been argued that acceleration in the amplified\nfields allows the CR spectrum from SNRs to reach the knee in the spectrum or,\nin special objects, even beyond. The above results are furthermore used to\ninvestigate the time evolution of field amplification in young SNRs. Although\nthe uncertainties in the data do not allow precise conclusions regarding this\npoint, they rather clearly show that the ratio of the magnetic field energy\ndensity and the kinetic energy density of gas flow into the shock is of the\norder of a few percent if the shock speed is high enough V_s > 10^3 km/s, and\nthis ratio remains nearly constant during the SNR evolution.

For\nthe purpose, the dynamical evolution of gas clouds is pursued, including the\neffects of radiation forces by an AGN as well as a starburst. Here, we solve\nthe radiative transfer equations for clouds, taking into consideration the\ngrowth of clouds by inelastic cloud-cloud collisions and the resultant change\nin optical depth. As a result, it is shown that if the starburst is more\nluminous than the AGN, gas clouds are distributed extensively above a galactic\ndisk with the assistance of radiation pressure from the starburst. The total\ncovering factor of gas clouds reaches a maximum of around 20%. After several\n$10^{7}$yr, gas clouds with larger optical depth form by cloud-cloud collisions\nand thereafter the clouds fall back due to weakened radiation pressure. The\nlarger clouds undergo runaway growth and are eventually distributed around the\nequatorial plane on the inner sides of circumnuclear starburst regions. These\nclouds have an optical depth of several tens. The result is qualitatively\nconsistent with the putative tendency that Seyfert 2 galaxies appear more\nfrequently associated with starbursts than Seyfert 1s. On the other hand, if\nthe AGN luminosity overwhelms that of the starburst, almost all clouds are\nejected from the galaxy due to the radiation pressure from the AGN, resulting\nin the formation of a quasar-like object.

This paper discusses the modeling of uncertainties\nin aggregated thermostatically controlled loads using a state queueing (SQ)\nmodel. The cycling times of thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) vary\nwith the TCA types and sizes, as well as the ambient temperatures. The random\nconsumption of consumers, which shortens or prolongs a specific TCA cycling\nperiod, introduces another degree of uncertainty. By modifying the state\ntransition matrix, these random factors can be taken into account in a discrete\nSQ model. The impacts of considering load diversity in the SQ model while\nsimulating TCA setpoint response are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2004 05:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
