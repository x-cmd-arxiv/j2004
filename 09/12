We examine the impact of Sgr A East on molecular material at the\nGalactic center and find that there is no evidence that the expansion of this\nshell has moved a significant amount of the 50 km/s GMC. The western streamer,\nhowever, shows strong indications that it is composed of material swept-up by\nthe expansion of Sgr A East. Using the mass and kinematics of the western\nstreamer, we calculate an energy of E=(2-9)x10^{51} ergs for the progenitor\nexplosion and conclude that Sgr A East was most likely produced by a single\nsupernova. The temperature structure of molecular gas in the central ~20pc is\nalso analyzed in detail. We find that molecular gas has a ``two-temperature''\nstructure similar to that measured by Huttemeister et al. (2003a) on larger\nscales. The largest observed line ratios, however, cannot be understood in\nterms of a two-temperature model, and most likely result from absorption of\nNH3(3,3) emission by cool surface layers of clouds. By comparing the observed\nNH3 (6,6)-to-(3,3) line ratios, we disentangle three distinct molecular\nfeatures within a projected distance of 2pc from Sgr A*. Gas associated with\nthe highest line ratios shows kinematic signatures of both rotation and\nexpansion.

In this paper we address the question of stability of a\nvacuum non-singular black hole with de Sitter center to external perturbations.\nWe specify first two types of geometries with and without changes of topology.\nThen we derive the general equations for an arbitrary density profile and show\nthat in the whole range of the mass parameter $m$ objects described by\ngeometries with de Sitter center remain stable under axial perturbations. In\nthe case of the polar perturbations we find criteria of stability and study in\ndetail the case of the density profile $\\rho(r)=\\rho_0 e^{-r^3/r_0^2 r_g}$\nwhere $\\rho_0$ is the density of de Sitter vacuum at the center, $r_0$ is de\nSitter radius and $r_g$ is the Schwarzschild radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2004 14:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}

We provide further support for this\nconjecture by computing a one-loop dilatation operator in all (super)symmetric\nYang-Mills theories on the light-cone ranging from gluodynamics all the way to\nthe maximally supersymmetric N=4 theory. We demonstrate that the dilatation\noperator takes a remarkably simple form when realized in the space spanned by\nsingle-trace products of superfields separated by light-like distances. The\nlatter operators serve as generating functions for Wilson operators of the\nmaximal Lorentz spin and the scale dependence of the two are in the one-to-one\ncorrespondence with each other. In the maximally supersymmetric, N=4 theory all\nnonlocal light-cone operators are built from a single CPT self-conjugated\nsuperfield while for N=0,1,2 one has to deal with two distinct superfields and\ndistinguish three different types of such operators. We find that for the\nlight-cone operators built from only one species of superfields, the one-loop\ndilatation operator takes the same, universal form in all SYM theories and it\ncan be mapped in the multi-color limit into a Hamiltonian of the SL(2|N)\nHeisenberg (super)spin chain of length equal to the number of superfields\ninvolved. For \"mixed'' light-cone operators involving both superfields the\ndilatation operator for N<=2 receives an additional contribution from the\nexchange interaction between superfields on the light-cone which breaks its\nintegrability symmetry and creates a mass gap in the spectrum of anomalous\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 2004 20:44:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2004 11:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-05"}
