In particular,\ndespite the success of quantum information processing with NMR, recent work has\nshown that quantum states used in most of those experiments were not entangled.\nThis is because these states, derived by unitary transforms from the thermal\nequilibrium state, were too close to the maximally mixed state. We are thus\nmotivated to determine whether a given NMR state is entanglable - that is, does\nthere exist a unitary transform that entangles the state? The boundary between\nentanglable and nonentanglable thermal states is a function of the spin system\nsize $N$ and its temperature $T$. We provide new bounds on the location of this\nboundary using analytical and numerical methods; our tightest bound scales as\n$N \\sim T$, giving a lower bound requiring at least $N \\sim 22,000$ proton\nspins to realize an entanglable thermal state at typical laboratory NMR\nmagnetic fields.
