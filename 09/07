The\nscheduling of the observations allowed us to sample the properties of XTE\nJ1650-50 in different X-ray spectral states, namely the hard state, the steep\npower-law state and the thermal dominant state, according to the recent\nspectral classification of McClintock & Remillard. The hard state is consistent\nwith a compact jet dominating the spectral energy distribution at radio\nfrequencies; however, the current data suggest that its contribution as direct\nsynchrotron emission at higher energies may not be significant. In that case,\nXTE J1650-50 may be dominated by Compton processes (either inverse\nComptonization of thermal disk photons and/or SSC from the base of the compact\njet) in the X-ray regime. We, surprisingly, detect a faint level of radio\nemission in the thermal dominant state that may be consistent with the emission\nof previously ejected material interacting with the interstellar medium,\nsimilar (but on a smaller angular scale) to what was observed in XTE J1550-564\nby Corbel and co-workers. Based on the properties of radio emission in the\nsteep power-law state of XTE J1650-50, and taking into account the behavior of\nother black hole candidates (namely GX 339-4, XTE J1550-564, and XTE J1859+226)\nwhile in the intermediate and steep power-law states, we are able to present a\ngeneral pattern of behavior for the origin of radio emission in these two\nstates that could be important for understanding the accretion-ejection\ncoupling very close to the black hole event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2004 12:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Applying\nthe functional renormalization group, we calculate the universal scaling\nfunction for the self-energy at zero frequency but at all wave vectors within\nan approximation which truncates the flow equations of the irreducible vertices\nat the four-point level. The self-energy interpolates between the critical\nregime k << k_c and the short-wavelength regime k >> k_c, where k_c is the\ncrossover scale. In the critical regime, the self-energy correctly approaches\nthe asymptotic behavior Sigma(k) \\propto k^{2 - eta}, and in the\nshort-wavelength regime the behavior is Sigma(k) \\propto k^{2(D-3)} in D>3. In\nD=3, we recover the logarithmic divergence Sigma(k) \\propto ln(k/k_c)\nencountered in perturbation theory. Our approach yields the crossover scale k_c\nas well as a reasonable estimate for the critical exponent eta in D=3. From our\nscaling function we find for the interaction-induced shift in T_c in three\ndimensions, Delta T_c / T_c = 1.23 a n^{1/3}, where a is the s-wave scattering\nlength and n is the density, in excellent agreement with other approaches. We\nalso discuss the flow of marginal parameters in D=3 and extend our truncation\nscheme of the renormalization group equations by including the six- and\neight-point vertex, which yields an improved estimate for the anomalous\ndimension eta \\approx 0.0513. We further calculate the constant lim_{k->0}\nSigma(k)/k^{2-eta} and find good agreement with recent Monte-Carlo data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2004 15:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For this we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, both at\nzero temperature as well as at finite temperatures. All calculations can be\ndone efficiently in polynomial time by a dynamic programming algorithm. We do\nnot find a sign for transition between the models, but the critical exponent\n$\\nu$ of the correlation length, describing the phase transition in all models\nto an ordered low-temperature phase, seems to depend continuously on the model.\nFinally, we apply the epsilon-Coupling method, to study low excitations.

This well-studied system has a\nrich variety of dynamical behavior depending on parameters, displays\ninteresting phenomena such as fractal spectra, mixed phase space, dynamical\nlocalization, anomalous diffusion, or partial delocalization, and can describe\nelectrons in a magnetic field. Three different quantum algorithms are presented\nand analyzed, enabling to simulate efficiently the evolution operator of this\nsystem with different precision using different resources. Depending on the\nparameters chosen, the system is near-integrable, localized, or partially\ndelocalized. In each case we identify transport or spectral quantities which\ncan be obtained more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical one.\nIn most cases, a polynomial gain compared to classical algorithms is obtained,\nwhich can be quadratic or less depending on the parameter regime. We also\npresent the effects of static imperfections on the quantities selected, and\nshow that depending on the regime of parameters, very different behaviors are\nobserved. Some quantities can be obtained reliably with moderate levels of\nimperfection, whereas others are exponentially sensitive to imperfection\nstrength. In particular, the imperfection threshold for delocalization becomes\nexponentially small in the partially delocalized regime. Our results show that\ninteresting behavior can be observed with as little as 7-8 qubits, and can be\nreliably measured in presence of moderate levels of internal imperfections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2004 17:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
